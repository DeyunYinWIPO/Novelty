5,2233473,"2d shape representation and similarity measurement for 3d recognition problems: an experimental analysis. one of the most usual strategies for tackling the 3d object recognition problem consists of representing the objects by their appearance. 3d recognition can therefore be converted into a 2d shape recognition matter. this paper is focused on carrying out an in depth qualitative and quantitative analysis with regard to the performance of 2d shape recognition methods when they are used to solve 3d object recognition problems. well known shape descriptors (contour and regions) and 2d similarities measurements (deterministic and stochastic) are thus combined to evaluate a wide range of solutions. in order to quantify the efficiency of each approach we propose three parameters: hard recognition rate (hr), weak recognition rate (wr) and ambiguous recognition rate (ar). these parameters therefore open the evaluation to active recognition methods which deal with uncertainty. up to 42 combined methods have been tested on two different experimental platforms using public database models. a detailed report of the results and a discussion, including detailed remarks and recommendations, are presented at the end of the paper.

5,34368580,"planning sequences of views for 3-d object recognition and pose determination. we present a method for planning sequences of views for recognition and pose (orientation) determination of 3-d objects of arbitrary shape. the approach consists of a learning stage in which we derive a recognition and pose identification plan and a stage in which actual recognition and pose identification take place. in the learning stage, the objects are observed from all possible views and each view is characterized by an extracted feature vector. these vectors are then used to structure the views into clusters based on their proximity in the feature space. to resolve the remaining ambiguity within each of the clusters, we designed a strategy which exploits the idea of taking additional views. we developed an original procedure which analyzes the transformation of individual clusters under changing viewpoints into several smaller clusters. this results in an optimal next-view planning when additional views are necessary to resolve the ambiguities. this plan then guides the actual recognition and pose determination of an unknown object in an unknown pose.

5,35189878,"a comparison of probabilistic, possibilistic and evidence theoretic fusion schemes for active object recognition. one major goal of active object recognition systems is to extract useful information from multiple measurements. we compare three frameworks for information fusion and view-planning using different uncertainty calculi: probability theory, possibility theory and dempster-shafer theory of evidence. the system dynamically repositions the camera to capture additional views in order to improve the classification result obtained from a single view. the active recognition problem can be tackled successfully by all the considered approaches with sometimes only slight differences in performance. extensive experiments confirm that recognition rates can be improved considerably by performing active steps. random selection of the next action is much less efficient than planning, both in recognition rate and in the average number of steps required for recognition. as long as the rate of wrong object-pose classifications stays low the probabilistic implementation always outperforms the other approaches. if the outlier rate increases averaging fusion schemes outperform conjunctive approaches for information integration. we use an appearance based object representation, namely the parametric eigenspace, but the planning algorithm is actually independent of the details of the specific object recognition environment.

5,36669844,"on the independence of rotation moment invariants. the problem of the independence and completeness of rotation moment invariants is addressed in this paper. first, a general method for constructing invariants of arbitrary orders by means of complex moments is described. as a major contribution of the paper, it is shown that for any set of invariants there exists a relatively small basis by means of which all other invariants can be generated. the method how to construct such a basis and how to prove its independence and completeness is presented. some practical impacts of the new results are mentioned at the end of the paper.

5,39041598,"feature space trajectory methods for active computer vision. we advance new active object recognition algorithms that classify rigid objects and estimate their pose from intensity images. our algorithms automatically detect if the class or pose of an object is ambiguous in a given image, reposition the sensor as needed, and incorporate data from multiple object views in determining the final object class and pose estimate. a probabilistic feature space trajectory (fst) in a global eigenspace is used to represent 3d distorted views of an object and to estimate the class and pose of an input object. confidence measures for the class and pose estimates, derived using the probabilistic fst object representation, determine when additional observations are required as well as where the sensor should be positioned to provide the most useful information. we demonstrate the ability to use fsts constructed from images rendered from computer-aided design models to recognize real objects in real images and present test results for a set of metal machined parts.

5,39602056,"an efficient k-means clustering algorithm: analysis and implementation. in k-means clustering, we are given a set of n data points in d-dimensional space r-d and an integer k and the problem is to determine a set of k points in r-d, called centers, so as to minimize the mean squared distance from each data point to its nearest center. a popular heuristic for k-means clustering is lloyd's algorithm. in this paper, we present a simple and efficient implementation of lloyd's k-means clustering algorithm, which we call the filtering algorithm. this algorithm is easy to implement, requiring a kd-tree as the only major data structure. we establish the practical efficiency of the filtering algorithm in two ways. first, we present a data-sensitive analysis of the algorithm's running time, which shows that the algorithm runs faster as the separation between clusters increases. second, we present a number of empirical studies both on synthetically generated data and on real data sets from applications in color quantization, data compression, and image segmentation.

5,40070474,"viewpoint selection - planning optimal sequences of views for object recognition. in the past decades most object recognition systems were based on passive approaches. but in the last few years a lot of research was done in the field of active object recognition. in this context there are several unique problems to be solved, like the fusion of several views and the selection of the best next viewpoint. 
 in this paper we present an approach to solve the problem of choosing optimal views (viewpoint selection) and the fusion of these for an optimal 3d object recognition (viewpoint fusion). we formally define the selection of additional views as an optimization problem and we show how to use reinforcement learning for viewpoint training and selection in continuous state spaces without user interaction. we also present an approach for the fusion of multiple views based on recursive density propagation. 
 the experimental results show that our viewpoint selection is able to select a minimal number of views and perform an optimal object recognition with respect to the classification.

5,40648813,"image registration methods: a survey. this paper aims to present a review of recent as well as classic image registration methods. image registration is the process of overlaying images (two or more) of the same scene taken at different times, from different viewpoints, and/or by different sensors. the registration geometrically align two images (the reference and sensed images). the reviewed approaches are classified according to their nature (area-based and feature-based) and according to four basic steps of image registration procedure: feature detection, feature matching, mapping function design, and image transformation and resampling. main contributions, advantages, and drawbacks of the methods are mentioned in the paper. problematic issues of image registration and outlook for the future research are discussed too. the major goal of the paper is to provide a comprehensive reference source for the researchers involved in image registration, regardless of particular application areas.

5,42039394,"active recognition through next view planning: a survey. 3-d object recognition involves using image-computable features to identify 3-d object. a single view of a 3-d object may not contain sufficient features to recognize it unambiguously. one needs to plan different views around the given object in order to recognize it. such a task involves an active sensor-one whose parameters (external and/or internal) can be changed in a purposive manner. in this paper, we review two important applications of an active sensor. we first survey important approaches to active 3-d object recognition. next, we review existing approaches towards another important application of an active sensor namely, that of scene analysis and interpretation.

5,49015889,"active object recognition based on fourier descriptors clustering. this paper presents a new 3d object recognition/pose strategy based on fourier descriptors clustering for silhouettes. the method consists of two parts. firstly, an off-line process calculates and stores a clustered fourier descriptors database corresponding to the silhouettes of the synthetic model of the object viewed from multiple viewpoints. next, an on-line process solves the recognition/pose problem for an object that is sensed by a camera placed at the end of a robotic arm. the method solves the ambiguity problem - due to object symmetries or similar projections belonging to different objects - by taking a minimum number of additional views of the scene which are selected through a heuristic next best view (nbv) algorithm. the method works in reduced computational time conditions and provides identification and pose of the object. a validation test of this method has been carried out in our lab yielding excellent results.

6,663650,"estimated carbon dioxide emissions from tropical deforestation improved by carbon-density maps. deforestation contributes 6-17% of global anthropogenic co2 emissions to the atmosphere(1). large uncertainties in emission estimates arise from inadequate data on the carbon density of forests' and the regional rates of deforestation. consequently there is an urgent need for improved data sets that characterize the global distribution of aboveground biomass, especially in the tropics. here we use multi-sensor satellite data to estimate aboveground live woody vegetation carbon density for pan-tropical ecosystems with unprecedented accuracy and spatial resolution. results indicate that the total amount of carbon held in tropical woody vegetation is 228.7 pg c, which is 21% higher than the amount reported in the global forest resources assessment 2010 (ref. 3). at the national level, brazil and indonesia contain 35% of the total carbon stored in tropical forests and produce the largest emissions from forest loss. combining estimates of aboveground carbon stocks with regional deforestation rates(4) we estimate the total net emission of carbon from tropical deforestation and land use to be 1.0 pg c yr(-1) over the period 2000-2010-based on the carbon bookkeeping model. these new data sets of aboveground carbon stocks will enable tropical nations to meet their emissions reporting requirements (that is, united nations framework convention on climate change tier 3) with greater accuracy.

6,35114926,"the annual net flux of carbon to the atmosphere from changes in land use 1850-1990. rates of land-use change, including clearing for agriculture and harvest of wood, were reconstructed from statistical and historic documents for 9 world regions and used, along with the per ha changes in vegetation and soil that result from land management, to calculate the annual flux of carbon between land and atmosphere. between 1850 and 1990, changes in land use are calculated to have added 124 pgc to the atmosphere, about half as much as released from combustion of fossil fuels over this period. about 108 pgc are estimated to have been transferred from forests to the atmosphere as a result of human activity, 2/3 from tropical forests and 1/3 from temperate zone and boreal forests. another 16 pgc were lost from non-forests, largely as a result of cultivation of midlatitude grassland soils. about 800 x 10(6) ha of forest were cleared for agricultural purposes, and approximately 2000 x 10(6) ha were harvested. conversion of forests to agricultural lands released 105 pgc; harvest of wood released about 20 pgc. these estimates of release include the accumulations of carbon in wood products (17 pgc) and woody debris (4 pgc), the losses of carbon from oxidation of wood products, woody debris, and soil organic matter (373 pgc in total), and the accumulations of carbon in forests recovering from harvest and in the fallows of shifting cultivation (249 pgc). over the decade of the 1980s the annual net flux of carbon from changes in land use averaged about 2.0 pgc yr(-1), higher than the 1.6 pgc yr(-1) estimated previously. almost all of this bur was from tropical regions, where rates of deforestation averaged approximately 15 x 10(6) ha yr(-1). outside the tropics, regrowth of forests logged in earlier years largely balanced the losses of carbon from oxidation of wood products.

6,38053851,"the spatial distribution of forest biomass in the brazilian amazon: a comparison of estimates. the amount of carbon released to the atmosphere as a result of deforestation is determined, in part, by the amount of carbon held in the biomass of the forests converted to other uses. uncertainty in forest biomass is responsible for much of the uncertainty in current estimates of the flux of carbon from land-use change. in the present contribution several estimates of forest biomass are compared for the brazilian amazon, based on spatial interpolations of direct measurements, relationships to climatic variables, and remote sensing data. three questions were posed: first, do the methods yield similar estimates? second, do they yield similar spatial patterns of distribution of biomass? and, third, what factors need most attention if we are to predict more accurately the distribution of forest biomass over large areas? 
 the answer to the first two questions is that estimates of biomass for brazil's amazonian forests (including dead and belowground biomass) vary by more than a factor of two, from a low of 39 pgc to a high of 93 pgc. furthermore, the estimates disagree as to the regions of high and low biomass. the lack of agreement among estimates confirms the need for reliable determination of aboveground biomass over large areas. potential methods include direct measurement of biomass through forest inventories with improved allometric regression equations, dynamic modelling of forest recovery following observed stand-replacing disturbances, and estimation of aboveground biomass from airborne or satellite-based instruments sensitive to the vertical structure plant canopies.

6,38985867,"carbon emissions from tropical deforestation and regrowth based on satellite observations for the 1980s and 1990s. carbon fluxes from tropical deforestation and regrowth are highly uncertain components of the contemporary carbon budget, due in part to the lack of spatially explicit and consistent information on changes in forest area. we estimate fluxes for the 1980s and 1990s using subpixel estimates of percent tree cover derived from coarse (national oceanic and atmospheric administration's advanced very high resolution radiometer) satellite data in combination with a terrestrial carbon model. the satellite-derived estimates of change in forest area are lower than national reports and remote-sensing surveys from the united nations food and agriculture organization forest resource assessment (fra) in all tropical regions, especially for the 1980s. however, our results indicate that the net rate of tropical forest clearing increased approximate to10% from the 1980s to 1990s, most notably in southeast asia, in contrast to an 11% reduction reported by the fra. we estimate net mean annual carbon fluxes from tropical deforestation and regrowth to average 0.6 (0.3-0.8) and 0.9 (0.5-1.4) petagrams (pg)(.)yr(-1) for the 1980s and 1990s, respectively. compared with previous estimates of 1.9 (0.6-2.5) pg(.)yr(-1) based on fra national statistics of changes in forest area, this alternative estimate suggests less missing carbon from the global carbon budget but increasing emissions from tropical land-use change.

6,39278542,"the amount of carbon released from peat and forest fires in indonesia during 1997. tropical peatlands are one of the largest near-surface reserves of terrestrial organic carbon, and hence their stability has important implications for climate change(1-3). in their natural state, lowland tropical peatlands support a luxuriant growth of peat swamp forest overlying peat deposits up to 20 metres thick(4,5). persistent environmental change-in particular, drainage and forest clearing-threatens their stability 2, and makes them susceptible to fire(6). this was demonstrated by the occurrence of widespread fires throughout the forested peatlands of indonesia(7-10) during the 1997 el nino event. here, using satellite images of a 2.5 million hectare study area in central kalimantan, borneo, from before and after the 1997 fires, we calculate that 32% (0.79 mha) of the area had burned, of which peatland accounted for 91.5% (0.73 mha). using ground measurements of the burn depth of peat, we estimate that 0.19-0.23 gigatonnes (gt) of carbon were released to the atmosphere through peat combustion, with a further 0.05 gt released from burning of the overlying vegetation. extrapolating these estimates to indonesia as a whole, we estimate that between 0.81 and 2.57 gt of carbon were released to the atmosphere in 1997 as a result of burning peat and vegetation in indonesia. this is equivalent to 13-40% of the mean annual global carbon emissions from fossil fuels, and contributed greatly to the largest annual increase in atmospheric co2 concentration detected since records began in 1957 (ref. 1).

6,41124472,"revised estimates of the annual net flux of carbon to the atmosphere from changes in land use and land management 1850-2000. recent analyses of land-use change in the us and china, together with the latest estimates of tropical deforestation and afforestation from the fao, were used to calculate a portion of the annual flux of carbon between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. the calculated flux includes only that portion of the flux resulting from direct human activity. in most regions, activities included the conversion of natural ecosystems to cultivated lands and pastures, including shifting cultivation, harvest of wood (for timber and fuel) and the establishment of tree plantations. in the us, woody encroachment and woodland thickening as a result of fire suppression were also included. the calculated flux of carbon does not include increases or decreases in carbon storage as a result of environmental changes (e.g., increasing concentrations of co2, n deposition, climatic change or pollution). globally, the long-term (1850-2000) flux of carbon from changes in land use and management released 156 pgc to the atmosphere, about 60% of it from the tropics. average annual fluxes during the 1980s and 1990s were 2.0 and 2.2 pgc yr(-1), respectively, dominated by releases of carbon from the tropics. outside the tropics, the average net flux of carbon attributable to land-use change and management decreased from a source of 0.06 pgc yr(-1) during the 1980s to a sink of 0.02 pgc yr(-1) during the 1990s. according to the analyses summarized here, changes in land use were responsible for sinks in north america and europe and for small sources in other non-tropical regions. the revisions were as large as 0.3 pgc yr(-1) in individual regions but were largely offsetting, so that the global estimate for the 1980s was changed little from an earlier estimate. uncertainties and recent improvements in the data used to calculate the flux of carbon from land-use change are reviewed, and the results are compared to other estimates of flux to evaluate the extent to which processes other than land-use change and management are important in explaining changes in terrestrial carbon storage.

6,41357370,"improved estimates of net carbon emissions from land cover change in the tropics for the 1990s. [1] recent figures on net forest cover change rates of the world's tropical forest cover are used for the calculation of carbon fluxes in the global budget. by applying our deforestation findings in the humid tropics, complemented by published deforestation figures in the dry tropics, to refereed data on biomass, we produced new estimates of net carbon emissions. these estimates are supported by recent, independent estimations of net carbon emissions globally, over the brazilian amazon, and by observations of atmospheric co2 emissions over southeast asia. our best estimate for global net emissions from land-use change in the tropics is at 1.1 +/- 0.3 gt c yr(-1). this estimate includes emissions from conversion of forests ( representing 71% of budget) and loss of soil carbon after deforestation ( 20%), emissions from forest degradation ( 4.4%), emissions from the 1997 - 1998 indonesian exceptional fires ( 8.3%), and sinks from regrowths (-3.3%).

6,45833492,"critical analysis of root: shoot ratios in terrestrial biomes. one of the most common descriptors of the relationship between root and shoot biomass is the root : shoot ratio, which has become a core method for estimating root biomass from the more easily measured shoot biomass. previous reviews have examined root : shoot ratio data, but have only considered particular vegetation types and have not always critically reviewed the data used. reliable root : shoot ratios are needed for a wide range of vegetation types in order to improve the accuracy of root biomass estimates, including those required for estimating the effects of land management and land use change in national greenhouse gas inventories. 
 this study reviewed root : shoot ratios in terrestrial biomes. a key facet of our analysis was a critical methodological review, through which unreliable data were identified and omitted on the basis of specific criteria. of the 786 root : shoot ratio observations collated, 62% were omitted because of inadequate or unverifiable root sampling methods. when only the reliable data were examined, root : shoot ratios were found to be negatively related to shoot biomass, mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperature, forest stand age, and forest stand height. 
 although a single allometric equation derived in this study reliably predicted root biomass from shoot biomass for forests and woodlands, in general, the use of vegetation-specific root : shoot ratios were found to be a more accurate method for predicting root biomass. when the root : shoot ratio data collated here were applied to an analysis of the global carbon budget, there was a 50% increase in estimated global root carbon stock, and a 12% increase in estimated total carbon stock of terrestrial vegetation. the use of the vegetation-specific root : shoot ratios presented in this study is likely to substantially improve the accuracy of root biomass estimates for purposes such as carbon accounting and for studies of ecosystem dynamics.

6,49251056,"humid tropical forest clearing from 2000 to 2005 quantified by using multitemporal and multiresolution remotely sensed data. forest cover is an important input variable for assessing changes to carbon stocks, climate and hydrological systems, biodiversity richness, and other sustainability science disciplines. despite incremental improvements in our ability to quantify rates of forest clearing, there is still no definitive understanding on global trends. without timely and accurate forest monitoring methods, policy responses will be uninformed concerning the most basic facts of forest cover change. results of a feasible and cost-effective monitoring strategy are presented that enable timely, precise, and internally consistent estimates of forest clearing within the humid tropics. a probability-based sampling approach that synergistically employs low and high spatial resolution satellite datasets was used to quantify humid tropical forest clearing from 2000 to 2005. forest clearing is estimated to be 1.39% (se 0.084%) of the total biome area. this translates to an estimated forest area cleared of 27.2 million hectares (se 2.28 million hectares), and represents a 2.36% reduction in area of humid tropical forest. fifty-five percent of total biome clearing occurs within only 6% of the biome area, emphasizing the presence of forest clearing hotspots. forest loss in brazil accounts for 47.8% of total biome clearing, nearly four times that of the next highest country, indonesia, which accounts for 12.8%. over three-fifths of clearing occurs in latin america and over one-third in asia. africa contributes 5.4% to the estimated loss of humid tropical forest cover, reflecting the absence of current agro-industrial scale clearing in humid tropical africa.

6,49641509,"difficulties in tracking the long-term global trend in tropical forest area. the long-term trend in tropical forest area receives less scrutiny than the tropical deforestation rate. we show that constructing a reliable trend is difficult and evidence for decline is unclear, within the limits of errors involved in making global estimates. a time series for all tropical forest area, using data from forest resources assessments (fras) of the united nations food and agriculture organization, is dominated by three successively corrected declining trends. inconsistencies between these trends raise questions about their reliability, especially because differences seem to result as much from errors as from changes in statistical design and use of new data. a second time series for tropical moist forest area shows no apparent decline. the latter may be masked by the errors involved, but a forest return effect may also be operating, in which forest regeneration in some areas offsets deforestation (but not biodiversity loss) elsewhere. a better monitoring program is needed to give a more reliable trend. scientists who use fra data should check how the accuracy of their findings depends on errors in the data.

6,49793220,"climate regulation of fire emissions and deforestation in equatorial asia. drainage of peatlands and deforestation have led to large-scale fires in equatorial asia, affecting regional air quality and global concentrations of greenhouse gases. here we used several sources of satellite data with biogeochemical and atmospheric modeling to better understand and constrain fire emissions from indonesia, malaysia, and papua new guinea during 2000-2006. we found that average fire emissions from this region [128 +/- 51 (1 sigma) tg carbon (c) year(-1), t = 1012] were comparable to fossil fuel emissions. in borneo, carbon emissions from fires were highly variable, fluxes during the moderate 2006 el nino more than 30 times greater than those during the 2000 la nina (and with a 2000-2006 mean of 74 +/- 33 tg c yr(-1)). higher rates of forest loss and larger areas of peatland becoming vulnerable to fire in drought years caused a strong nonlinear relation between drought and fire emissions in southern borneo. fire emissions from sumatra showed a positive linear trend, increasing at a rate of 8 tg c year(-2) (approximately doubling during 2000-2006). these results highlight the importance of including deforestation in future climate agreements. they also imply that land manager responses to expected shifts in tropical precipitation may critically determine the strength of climate-carbon cycle feedbacks during the 21st century.

6,52583840,"current and future co2 emissions from drained peatlands in southeast asia. forested tropical peatlands in southeast asia store at least 42 000 million metric tonnes (mt) of soil carbon. human activity and climate change threatens the stability of this large pool, which has been decreasing rapidly over the last few decades owing to deforestation, drainage and fire. in this paper we estimate the carbon dioxide (co2) emissions resulting from drainage of lowland tropical peatland for agricultural and forestry development which dominates the perturbation of the carbon balance in the region. present and future emissions from drained peatlands are quantified using data on peatland extent and peat thickness, present and projected land use, water management practices and decomposition rates. of the 27.1 million hectares (mha) of peatland in southeast asia, 12.9 mha had been deforested and mostly drained by 2006. this latter area is increasing rapidly because of increasing land development pressures. carbon dioxide (co2) emission caused by decomposition of drained peatlands was between 355 mt y(-1) and 855 mt y(-1) in 2006 of which 82% came from indonesia, largely sumatra and kalimantan. at a global scale, co2 emission from peatland drainage in southeast asia is contributing the equivalent of 1.3% to 3.1% of current global co2 emissions from the combustion of fossil fuel. if current peatland development and management practices continue, these emissions are predicted to continue for decades. this warrants inclusion of tropical peatland co2 emissions in global greenhouse gas emission calculations and climate mitigation policies. uncertainties in emission calculations are discussed and research needs for improved estimates are identified.

6,53163044,"quantification of global gross forest cover loss. a globally consistent methodology using satellite imagery was implemented to quantify gross forest cover loss (gfcl) from 2000 to 2005 and to compare gfcl among biomes, continents, and countries. gfcl is defined as the area of forest cover removed because of any disturbance, including both natural and human-induced causes. gfcl was estimated to be 1,011,000 km(2) from 2000 to 2005, representing 3.1% (0.6% per year) of the year 2000 estimated total forest ;area of 32,688,000 km(2). the boreal biome experienced the largest area of gfcl, followed by the humid tropical, dry tropical, and temperate biomes. gfcl expressed as the proportion of year 2000 forest cover was highest in the boreal biome and lowest in the humid tropics. among continents, north america had the largest total area and largest proportion of year 2000 gfcl. at national scales, brazil experienced the largest area of gfcl over the study period, 165,000 km(2), followed by canada at 160,000 km(2). of the countries with &amp;gt; 1,000,000 km(2) of forest cover, the united states exhibited the greatest proportional gfcl and the democratic republic of congo the least. our results illustrate a pervasive global gfcl dynamic. however, gfcl represents only one component of net change, and the processes driving gfcl and rates of recovery from gfcl differ regionally. for example, the majority of estimated gfcl for the boreal biome is due to a naturally induced fire dynamic. to fully characterize global forest change dynamics, remote sensing efforts must extend beyond estimating gfcl to identify proximate causes of forest cover loss and to estimate recovery rates from gfcl.

6,54296167,"a large and persistent carbon sink in the world's forests. the terrestrial carbon sink has been large in recent decades, but its size and location remain uncertain. using forest inventory data and long-term ecosystem carbon studies, we estimate a total forest sink of 2.4 +/- 0.4 petagrams of carbon per year (pg c year(-1)) globally for 1990 to 2007. we also estimate a source of 1.3 +/- 0.7 pg c year(-1) from tropical land-use change, consisting of a gross tropical deforestation emission of 2.9 +/- 0.5 pg c year(-1) partially compensated by a carbon sink in tropical forest regrowth of 1.6 +/- 0.5 pg c year(-1). together, the fluxes comprise a net global forest sink of 1.1 +/- 0.8 pg c year(-1), with tropical estimates having the largest uncertainties. our total forest sink estimate is equivalent in magnitude to the terrestrial sink deduced from fossil fuel emissions and land-use change sources minus ocean and atmospheric sinks.

6,55825305,"benchmark map of forest carbon stocks in tropical regions across three continents. developing countries are required to produce robust estimates of forest carbon stocks for successful implementation of climate change mitigation policies related to reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (redd). here we present a benchmark map of biomass carbon stocks over 2.5 billion ha of forests on three continents, encompassing all tropical forests, for the early 2000s, which will be invaluable for redd assessments at both project and national scales. we mapped the total carbon stock in live biomass (above-and belowground), using a combination of data from 4,079 in situ inventory plots and satellite light detection and ranging (lidar) samples of forest structure to estimate carbon storage, plus optical and microwave imagery (1-km resolution) to extrapolate over the landscape. the total biomass carbon stock of forests in the study region is estimated to be 247 gt c, with 193 gt c stored aboveground and 54 gt c stored belowground in roots. forests in latin america, sub-saharan africa, and southeast asia accounted for 49%, 25%, and 26% of the total stock, respectively. by analyzing the errors propagated through the estimation process, uncertainty at the pixel level (100 ha) ranged from +/- 6% to +/- 53%, but was constrained at the typical project (10,000 ha) and national (&amp;gt;1,000,000 ha) scales at ca. +/- 5% and ca. +/- 1%, respectively. the benchmark map illustrates regional patterns and provides methodologically comparable estimates of carbon stocks for 75 developing countries where previous assessments were either poor or incomplete.

 study design: all ntdb entries with abbreviated injury scale codes for spleen, liver, and kidney were classified by ois grade. injuries were stratified either as an isolated intraabdominal organ injury or in combination with other abdominal injuries. isolated abdominal solid organ injuries were additionally stratified by presence of severe head injury and survival past 24 hours. the patients in each grading category were analyzed for mortality, operative rate, hospital length of stay, icu length of stay, and charges incurred. 
 results: there were 54,148 ntdb entries (2.7%) with abbreviated injury scale-coded injuries to the spleen, liver, or kidney. in 35,897, this was an isolated abdominal solid organ injury. for patients in which the solid organ in question was not the sole abdominal injury, a statistically significant increase (p &amp;lt;= 0.05) in mortality, organ-specific operative rate, and hospital charges was associated with increasing ois grade; the exception was grade vi hepatic injuries. hospital and icu lengths of stay did not show substantial increase with increasing ois grade. when isolated organ injuries were examined, there were statistically significant increases (p : 0.05) in all outcomes variables corresponding with increasing ois grade. severe head injury appears to influence mortality, but none of the other outcomes variables. patients with other intraabdominal injuries had comparable quantitative outcomes results with the isolated abdominal organ injury groups for all ois grades. 
 conclusions: this study validates and quantifies outcomes reflective of increasing injury severity associated with increasing ois grades for specific solid organ injuries alone, and in combination with other abdominal injuries.

8,34336424,"optically stimulated luminescence of al2o3. anion-deficient aluminum oxide doped with carbon (al2o3:c) is not only an extremely sensitive thermoluminescence (tl) material, but is well suited to optically stimulated luminescence osl applications due to a high cross-section for interaction of light with radiation-induced trapped charge. several different osl readout protocols have been suggested, including pulsed osl (posl), and delayed osl (dosl). this paper examines the properties of al2o3:c for application using these two readout protocols. the posl technique utilizes the prompt luminescence that results from the direct recombination of released charge carriers at luminescence sites (f-centers in al2o3:c). following a pulse of stimulation light using a laser, the posl signal is observed to decay with a temperature-independent lifetime of similar to 35-36 ms. the dosl signal, on the other hand, utilizes the temperature-dependent signal resulting from the capture of released charge carriers by shallow traps. the decay of the luminescence component after the stimulating pulse has a lifetime of several hundred ms, depending upon temperature. the dependence of the dosl signal on readout temperature can be explained in terms of the involvement of the shallow traps in the process. however, the intensity (not the lifetime) of the posl signal is also slightly temperature dependent. it is conjectured that this may be caused by a thermally assisted optical detrapping process involving localized excited states. different forms of al2o3:c are examined. by modifying both the concentration and energy distribution of the shallow traps material optimized for dosl applications can be engineered. in contrast, the best material for posl is grown with no shallow traps. the integrated light output in a typical posl measurement is approximately a factor of 7-8 greater than that of dosl, even for a dosl-quality sample.

8,41408552,"real-time luminescence from al2o3 fiber dosimeters. the real-time luminescence signal from al2o3 single crystal fibers, monitored during simultaneous irradiation and optical stimulation, was investigated using computer simulations and experimental measurements. both radio luminescence (rl) and optically stimulated luminescence (osl) signals were studied. the simulations were performed initially using a simple one-trap/one-recombination-center energy band model, and then extended to include shallow and deep electron traps as well. real-time luminescence experiments were performed for different radiation dose rates and optical stimulation powers using periodic laser stimulation of the samples through a fiber optic cable, and the experimental results were compared with the predictions from the computer simulations. the luminescence signal was observed, both theoretically and experimentally, to increase from its initial value to a steady-state level. the steady-state rl and osl levels were found to be dependent oil dose rate, the steady-state level of the real-time osl being independent of laser power. it was also shown that the total integrated absorbed dose throughout the irradiation period can be determined by correcting the real-time osl signal for depiction caused by each laser stimulation pulse. the effects of the shallow and deep traps oil the time-dependence of the real-time luminescence signal were studied comparing the experimental data from several al2o3 fibers known to have different trapping state concentrations. the additional traps were found to slow the response of the real-time luminescence such that the time to reach steady state was increased as the additional traps were added.

8,42016197,"concerning secondary thermoluminescence peaks in alpha-al2o3 : c. thermoluminescence characteristics of two subsidiary glow peaks, one below 100 degrees c and the other above 300 degrees c, have been studied for measurements between 30 degrees c and 500 degrees c in alpha-al2o3:c. the thermoluminescence intensity of the lower temperature peak decreased with storage with a half-life of about 150 s. in contrast, the intensity of the higher temperature peak increased with storage towards some maximum. the peak-temperature of each of the secondary glow peaks was essentially constant with dose, whereas that of the main peak decreased with irradiation. the dose response for the three peaks was similar except for sublinear growth in the higher temperature peak at low dose values. these effects are discussed in terms of changes in the concentration of f+ luminescence precursors brought about by competitive electron retrapping at deep electron-traps or hole-traps. this work refines the physics and application of alpha-al2o3:c luminescence in radiation dosimetry.

8,47486101,"technical performance of the luxel al2o3 : c optically stimulated luminescence dosemeter element at radiation oncology and nuclear accident dose levels. the dose ranges typical for radiation oncology and nuclear accident dosimetry are on the order of 2-70 gy and 0.1-5 gy, respectively. in terms of solid-state passive dosimetry, thermoluminescent (tl) materials historically have been used extensively for these two applications, with silver-halide, leuco-dye and bafbr:eu-based films being used on a more limited basis than tl for radiation oncology. this present work provides results on the performance of a film based on an aluminum oxide, al2o3:c, for these dosimetry applications, using the optically stimulated luminescence (osl) readout method. there have been few investigations of al2o3:c performance at radiation oncology and nuclear accident dose levels, and these have included minimal dosimetric and environmental effects information. based on investigations already published, the authors of this present study determined that overall improvements over film and tlds for this al2o3:c osl technology at radiation oncology and nuclear accident dose levels may include (1) a more tissue-equivalent response to photons compared to x-ray film, (2) higher sensitivity, (3) ability to reread dosemeters and (4) diagnostic capability using small-area imaging. the results of the present investigation indicate that additional favourable performance characteristics for the al2o3:c dosemeter are a wide dynamic range (0.001-100 gy), a response insensitive to temperature and moisture over a wide range, negligible dose rate dependence, and minimal change in post-irradiation response. as a radiation detection medium, this osl phosphor offers an assortment of dosimetry properties that will permit it to compete with current radiation detection technologies such as silver-halide, leuco-dye and photostimulable-phosphor-based films, as well as tlds.

8,50220598,"the energy dependence and dose response of a commercial optically stimulated luminescent detector for kilovoltage photon, megavoltage photon, and electron, proton, and carbon beams. optically stimulated luminescent detectors, which are widely used in radiation protection, offer a number of potential advantages for application in radiation therapy dosimetry. their introduction into this field has been somewhat hampered by the lack of information on their radiation response in megavoltage beams. here the response of a commercially available optically stimulated luminescent detector (osld) is determined as a function of energy, absorbed dose to water, and linear energy transfer (let). the detector response was measured as a function of energy for absorbed doses from 0.5 to 4.0 gy over the following ranges: 125 kvp to18 mv for photons, 6-20 mev for electrons, 50-250 mev for protons, and 290 mev/u for the carbon ions. for the low let beams, the response of the detector was linear up to 2 gy with supralinearity occurring at higher absorbed doses. for the kilovoltage photons, the detector response relative to 6 mv increased with decreasing energy due to the higher atomic number of aluminum oxide (11.2) relative to water (7.4). for the megavoltage photons and electrons, the response was independent of energy. the response for protons was also independent of energy, but it was about 6% higher than its response to 6 mv photons. for the carbon ions, the dose response was linear for a given let from 0.5 to 4.0 gy, and no supralinearity was observed. however, it did exhibit let dependence on the response relative to 6 mv photons decreasing from 1.02 at 1.3 kev/mu m to 0.41 at 78 kev/mu m. these results provide additional information on the dosimetric properties for this particular osl detector and also demonstrate the potential for their use in photon, electron, and proton radiotherapy dosimetry with a more limited use in high let radiotherapy dosimetry.

8,53687177,"changes in optically stimulated luminescent dosimeter (osld) dosimetric characteristics with accumulated dose. purpose: a new type of in vivo dosimeter, an optically stimulated luminescent dosimeter (osld), has now become commercially available for clinical use. the osld is a plastic disk infused with aluminum oxide doped with carbon (al(2)o(3):c). crystals of al(2)o(3):c, when exposed to ionizing radiation, store energy that is released as luminescence (420 nm) when the osld is illuminated with stimulation light (540 nm). the intensity of the luminescence depends on the dose absorbed by the osld and the intensity of the stimulation light. the effects of accumulated dose on osld response were investigated. 
 methods: the oslds used in this work were nanodot dosimeters, which were read with a microstar reader (landauer, inc., glenwood, il). dose to the oslds was delivered by 6 mv x rays and gamma rays from co-60 and ir-192. the signal on the oslds after irradiation is removed by optical annealing with a 150 w tungsten-halogen lamp or a 14 w compact fluorescent lamp was investigated. 
 results: it was found that osld response to dose was supralinear and this response was altered with the amount of accumulated dose to the osld. the osld response can be modeled by a quadratic and an exponential equation. for accumulated doses up to 60 gy, the osld sensitivity (counts/dose) decreases and the extent of supralinear increases. above 60 gy of accumulated dose the sensitivity increases and the extent of supralinearity decreases or reaches a plateau, depending on how the oslds were optically annealed. with preirradiation of oslds with greater than 1 kgy, it is found that the sensitivity reaches a plateau 2.5 folds greater than that of an osld with no accumulated dose and the supralinearity disappears. a regeneration of the luminescence signal in the dark after full optical annealing occurs with a half time of about two days. the extent of this regeneration signal depends on the amount of accumulated dose. 
 conclusions: for in vivo dosimetric measurements, a precision of (0.5% can be achieved if the sensitivity and extent of supralinearity is established for each osld and use. methods are presented for accomplishing this task.

11,44014345,"interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing practices in ambulatory care. background the development of resistance to antibiotics by many important human pathogens has been linked to exposure to antibiotics over time. the misuse of antibiotics for viral infections (for which they are of no value) and the excessive use of broad spectrum antibiotics in place of narrower spectrum antibiotics have been well-documented throughout the world. many studies have helped to elucidate the reasons physicians use antibiotics inappropriately. 
 objectives to systematically review the literature to estimate the effectiveness of professional interventions, alone or in combination, in improving the selection, dose and treatment duration of antibiotics prescribed by healthcare providers in the outpatient setting; and to evaluate the impact of these interventions on reducing the incidence of antimicrobial resistant pathogens. 
 search strategy we searched the cochrane effective practice and organisation of care group (epoc) specialized register for studies relating to antibiotic prescribing and ambulatory care. additional studies were obtained from the bibliographies of retrieved articles, the scientific citation index and personal files. 
 selection criteria we included all randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials (rct and qrct), controlled before and after studies (cba) and interrupted time series (its) studies of healthcare consumers or healthcare professionals who provide primary care in the outpatient setting. interventions included any professional intervention, as defined by epoc, or a patient-based intervention. 
 data collection and analysis two review authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality. 
 main results thirty-nine studies examined the effect of printed educational materials for physicians, audit and feedback, educational meetings, educational outreach visits, financial and healthcare system changes, physician reminders, patient-based interventions and multi-faceted interventions. these interventions addressed the overuse of antibiotics for viral infections, the choice of antibiotic for bacterial infections such as streptococcal pharyngitis and urinary tract infection, and the duration of use of antibiotics for conditions such as acute otitis media. use of printed educational materials or audit and feedback alone resulted in no or only small changes in prescribing. the exception was a study documenting a sustained reduction in macrolide use in finland following the publication of a warning against their use for group a streptococcal infections. interactive educational meetings appeared to be more effective than didactic lectures. educational outreach visits and physician reminders produced mixed results. patient-based interventions, particularly the use of delayed prescriptions for infections for which antibiotics were not immediately indicated effectively reduced antibiotic use by patients and did not result in excess morbidity. multi-faceted interventions combining physician, patient and public education in a variety of venues and formats were the most successful in reducing antibiotic prescribing for inappropriate indications. only one of four studies demonstrated a sustained reduction in the incidence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria associated with the intervention. 
 authors&amp;apos; conclusions the effectiveness of an intervention on antibiotic prescribing depends to a large degree on the particular prescribing behaviour and the barriers to change in the particular community. no single intervention can be recommended for all behaviours in any setting. multi-faceted interventions where educational interventions occur on many levels may be successfully applied to communities after addressing local barriers to change. these were the only interventions with effect sizes of sufficient magnitude to potentially reduce the incidence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. future research should focus on which elements of these interventions are the most effective. in addition, patient-based interventions and physician reminders show promise and innovative methods such as these deserve further study.

11,46650471,"can mass media campaigns change antimicrobial prescribing? a regional evaluation study. background: antimicrobial drug resistance is a significant cause of avoidable morbidity and mortality. inappropriate prescribing of antimicrobials is acknowledged as a key determinant of this phenomenon. many approaches are advocated for reducing this inappropriate prescribing, including regulatory, professional and educational interventions. mass media campaigns are often suggested as a useful tool in managing public expectations, but the evidence to support this is weak, as no controlled studies of such campaigns exist. evaluating such campaigns is problematic, and uncontrolled observations are misleading. we report here the first controlled study of such an intervention in the use of antimicrobials. 
 methods: two sequential mass media campaigns, providing information on the appropriate use of antimicrobials, were conducted during early 2004 and 2005 in the north east of england. these messages were articulated in the campaign by the cartoon character 'moxy malone'. the campaigns were supported by printed materials, and in parts of this area, with professional education and prescribing support. a retrospective controlled before-after study was conducted, examining the effects on observed prescribing of antimicrobials for the populations covered by these two cycles of mass media campaigns. these populations were controlled with matched populations in the north of england. the primary outcome examined was prescribing rates (items) for all microbial agents for these populations, corrected for population structure (star-pu). a repeated measures analysis of variance (anova) was used to analyse factors that had a possible effect on the prescribing of antibacterial drugs. this was supported by a survey of primary care organizations (pcos) of all interventions undertaken around antimicrobial use in the intervention and comparison populations. 
 results: in this retrospective study, there was incomplete reporting of adjuvant interventions undertaken by the pcos intervention and comparison areas, so isolating the intervention, and attributing cause and effect is difficult. in this pragmatic evaluation the campaign was found to significantly reduce the volume of antibacterial drugs during the winter months of the intervention years. there were 21.7 fewer items prescribed per 1000 population (p &amp;lt; 0.0005), for the intervention populations over these winter months, equivalent to a 5.8% absolute reduction in prescribing. 
 conclusions: mass media campaigns have a role in changing antimicrobial prescribing practice.

11,47857992,"decline in pneumonia admissions after routine childhood immunisation with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in the usa: a time-series analysis. background routine infant immunisation with seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (pcv7) began in the usa in 2000. although invasive pneumococcal disease has declined substantially, the programme's effect on hospital admissions for pneumonia is unknown. we therefore assessed the effect of the programme on rates of all-cause and pneumococcal pneumonia admissions. 
 methods data from the nationwide inpatient sample, the largest inpatient database available in the usa, were analysed with an interrupted time-series analysis that used pneumonia (all-cause and pneumococcal) admission rates as the main outcomes. monthly admission rates estimated for years after the introduction of pcv7 vaccination (2001-2004) were compared with expected rates calculated from pre-pcv7 years (1997-1999). the year of vaccine introduction (2000) was excluded, and rates of admission for dehydration were assessed for comparison. 
 findings at the end of 2004, all-cause pneumonia admission rates had declined by 39% (95% ci 22-52) for children younger than 2 years, who were the target population of the vaccination programme. this annual decline in all-cause pneumonia admissions of 506 (291-675) per 100 000 children younger than 2 years represented about 41000 pneumonia admissions prevented in 2004. during the 8 study years, 10 659 (2%) children younger than 2 years admitted with pneumonia were coded as having pneumococcal disease; these rates declined by 65% (47-77). this decline represented about 17 fewer admissions per 100 000 children in 2004. admission rates for dehydration for children younger than 2 years remained stable over the study period. 
 interpretation the reduction in all-cause pneumonia admissions in children younger than 2 years provides an estimate of the proportion of childhood pneumonias attributable to streptococcus pneumoniae in the usa that are vaccine preventable. our results contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting the beneficial effects of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in children.

11,47956688,"an overview of the specialist advisory committee on antimicrobial resistance (sacar). in 1969, the swann committee reported that there was a significant problem with regard to antimicrobial (mis)use in both human and veterinary practice and recommended that the uk government establish a committee that should have overall responsibility for the whole field of antimicrobial use. this view was reiterated in 1997-8 by the house of lords science and technology committee, under the chairmanship of lord soulsby of swaffham prior. in 2001 such a group, the specialist advisory committee on antimicrobial resistance (sacar), was finally launched. sacar encompassed representatives from human and veterinary medicine and involved many branches of public health, pharmacy, nursing, bacteriology and virology. it met three times a year and has advised ministers and the chief medical officer on current and emerging problems by providing expert advice to inform local and national policy on antimicrobial resistance. this supplement provides an overview of the work of sacar and its subgroups.

 design pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial. 
 setting 61 general practices in wales and england. 
 participants 558 children (6 months to 14 years) presenting to primary care with an acute respiratory tract infection (7 days or less). children with suspected pneumonia, asthma or a serious concomitant illness, or needing immediate hospital admission were excluded. three withdrew and 27 were lost to follow-up, leaving 528 (94.6%) with main outcome data. 
 interventions clinicians in the intervention group were trained in the use of an interactive booklet on respiratory tract infections and asked to use the booklet during consultations with recruited patients (and provide it as a take home resource). clinicians in the control group conducted their consultations as usual. 
 main outcome measures the proportion of children who attended a face-to-face consultation about the same illness during the two week follow-up period. secondary outcomes included antibiotic prescribing, antibiotic consumption, future consulting intentions, and parental satisfaction, reassurance, and enablement. 
 results reconsultation occurred in 12.9% of children in the intervention group and 16.2% in the control group (absolute risk reduction 3.3%, 95% confidence interval-2.7% to 9.3%, p=0.29). using multilevel modelling (at the practice and individual level) to account for clustering, no significant difference in reconsulting was noted (odds ratio 0.75; 0.41 to 1.38). antibiotics were prescribed at the index consultation to 19.5% of children in the intervention group and 40.8% of children in the control group (absolute risk reduction 21.3%, 95% confidence interval 13.7 to 28.9), p&amp;lt;0.001). a significant difference was still present after adjusting for clustering (odds ratio 0.29; 0.14 to 0.60). there was also a significant difference in the proportion of parents who said they would consult in the future if their child developed a similar illness (odds ratio 0.34; 0.20 to 0.57). satisfaction, reassurance, and parental enablement scores were not significantly different between the two groups. 
 conclusions use of a booklet on respiratory tract infections in children within primary care consultations led to important reductions in antibiotic prescribing and reduced intention to consult without reducing satisfaction with care.

 study design: retrospective cohort study. 
 method: the ims health mediplus database was used to obtain annual antibiotic prescribing rates and associated clinical indications in 0-18-year-old patients between 1 january 1996 and 31 december 2006 in the uk. 
 results: antibiotic prescribing declined by 24% between 1996 and 2000 but increased again by 10% during 2003-2006. respiratory tract infection was the most common indication for which an antibiotic was prescribed, followed by abnormal signs and symptoms&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, ear and skin infections. antibiotic prescriptions for respiratory tract infections have decreased by 31% (p&amp;lt;0.01) mainly because of reduced prescribing for lower respiratory tract infections (56% decline, p&amp;lt;0.001) and specific upper respiratory tract infections including tonsillitis/pharyngitis (48% decline, p&amp;lt;0.001) and otitis (46% decline, p&amp;lt;0.001). prescribing for non-specific upper respiratory tract infection increased fourfold (p&amp;lt;0.001). prescribing for abnormal signs and symptoms&amp;apos;&amp;apos; increased significantly since 2001 (40% increase, p&amp;lt;0.001). 
 conclusion: there has been a marked decrease in community antibiotic prescribing linked to lower respiratory tract infection, tonsillitis, pharyngitis and otitis. overall prescribing is now increasing again but is associated with non-specific upper respiratory tract infection diagnoses. general practitioners may be avoiding using diagnoses where formal guidance suggests antibiotic prescribing is not indicated. the new nice guidance on upper respiratory tract infections is at risk of being ignored.

11,51607208,"stemming the tide of antibiotic resistance (star): a protocol for a trial of a complex intervention addressing the 'why' and 'how' of appropriate antibiotic prescribing in general practice. background: after some years of a downward trend, antibiotic prescribing rates in the community have tended to level out in many countries. there is also wide variation in antibiotic prescribing between general practices, and between countries. there are still considerable further gains that could be made in reducing inappropriate antibiotic prescribing, but complex interventions are required. studies to date have generally evaluated the effect of interventions on antibiotic prescribing in a single consultation and pragmatic evaluations that assess maintenance of new skills are rare. this paper describes the protocol for a pragmatic, randomized evaluation of a complex intervention aimed at reducing antibiotic prescribing by primary care clinicians. 
 methods and design: we developed a social learning theory based, blended learning program (on-line learning, a practice based seminar, and context bound learning) called the star educational program. the 'why of change' is addressed by providing clinicians in general practice with information on antibiotic resistance in urine samples submitted by their practice and their antibiotic prescribing data, and facilitating a practice-based seminar on the implications of this data. the 'how of change' is addressed through context-bound communication skills training and information on antibiotic indication and choice. this intervention will be evaluated in a trial involving 60 general practices, with general practice as the unit of randomization (clinicians from each practice to either receive the star educational program or not) and analysis. the primary outcome will be the number of antibiotic items dispensed over one year. an economic and process evaluation will also be conducted. 
 discussion: this trial will be the first to evaluate the effectiveness of this type of theory-based, blended learning intervention aimed at reducing antibiotic prescribing by primary care clinicians. novel aspects include feedback of practice level data on antimicrobial resistance and prescribing, use of principles from motivational interviewing, training in enhanced communication skills that incorporates context-bound experience and reflection, and using antibiotic dispensing over one year (as opposed to antibiotic prescribing in a single consultation) as the main outcome.

11,52261390,"the english antibiotic awareness campaigns: did they change the public&amp;apos;s knowledge of and attitudes to antibiotic use?. objectives: to determine the effect of the 2008 english public antibiotic campaigns. 
 methods: english and scottish (acting as controls) adults aged &amp;gt;= 15 years were questioned face to face about their attitudes to and use of antibiotics, in january 2008 (1888) before and in january 2009 (1830) after the antibiotic campaigns. 
 results: among english respondents, there was a small increase in recollection of campaign posters (2009 23.7% versus 2008 19.2%; p=0.03), but this increase was only 2.3% higher in england than in scotland. we did not detect any improvement in either england or scotland, or any differences between england and scotland in the understanding of the lack of benefit of antibiotics for coughs and colds, and we found no improvement in antibiotic use. we detected a significant increase in respondents retaining leftover antibiotics. over 20% reported discussing antibiotics with their general practitioner (gp) or nurse in the year to january 2009. the offer of a delayed antibiotic prescription was reported significantly more often by english respondents (19% versus 8% scottish in 2009; p=0.01), and english respondents were advised to use other remedies for coughs and colds significantly more often in the year to january 2009 (12.7% in 2009 versus 7.4% in 2008; p&amp;lt;0.001). 
 conclusions: there is little evidence that the 2008 public antibiotic campaigns were effective. the use and visibility of future campaign materials needs auditing. a carefully planned approach that targets the public in gp waiting rooms and through clinicians in consultations may be a more effective way of improving prudent antibiotic use.

 junior (9-11 years) and senior (12-15 years) school classes were divided into either control or intervention groups for evaluation of the resource. students were required to complete identical knowledge questionnaires at three timepoints (before, immediately after and 6 weeks after teaching), to assess knowledge change and retention. teaching, using the e-bug pack, was given by junior and senior school teachers. 
 the junior e-bug teaching pack demonstrated a significant improvement in student&amp;apos;s knowledge in all sections and there was no significant decrease in student knowledge observed after a 6 week period. knowledge improvement with the senior e-bug pack varied between regions, although consistent improvement was observed for gloucestershire (england) and ostrava (czech republic).

11,55364320,"does laboratory antibiotic susceptibility reporting influence primary care prescribing in urinary tract infection and other infections?. objectives: using a prospective interrupted time series design, our goal was to determine whether a change in urine antibiotic susceptibility reporting from co-amoxiclav to cefalexin to community clinicians served by south-mead general hospital led to a change in antibiotic prescribing. 
 methods: we used longitudinal data on antibiotic prescribing using a clinician questionnaire to identify prescribing for urinary tract infections (utis) when a urine specimen was submitted to microbiology; miquest computer search in general practices for prescribing for all utis in the community; and prescribing analysis and cost (pact) data to determine antibiotic prescribing for all infections. 
 results: cefalexin and cephalosporin prescribing increased when cefalexin was reported and co-amoxiclav prescribing decreased when co-amoxiclav was not reported by the laboratory. this was seen for episodes of uti in which a general practitioner (gp) sent a specimen as determined with: the questionnaire results (9-fold rise in cephalosporins, 70% fall in co-amoxiclav); episodes of uti identified by miquest searches in the practice (50% increase in cefalexin, 25% reduction in co-amoxiclav); and overall antibiotic prescribing in the practice determined with pact data (20% increase in cefalexin, 8% reduction in co-amoxiclav). miquest data indicated that prescribing reverted to pre-intervention levels once the change in antibiotic reporting had stopped. 
 conclusions: our data provide more evidence that changing laboratory antibiotic susceptibility reporting has a direct effect on antibiotic prescribing by gps. our data indicate that much of the change in prescribing was attributable to the use of cefalexin and co-amoxiclav for persistent or recurrent infections. microbiology laboratories can influence antibiotic use by selectively reporting antibiotics they would prefer gps to prescribe.

 methods: two meetings were convened to produce a list of disease-specific quality indicators for outpatient antibiotic prescribing which conform to internationally agreed recommendations, building on a similar development of drug-specific quality indicators, and in collaboration with champ and happy audit. 62 experts were asked to complete two scoring rounds of the proposed indicators on seven dimensions: their relevance to (1) reducing antimicrobial resistance, (2) patient health benefit, (3) cost-effectiveness, (4) policy makers, (5) individual prescribers, (6) their evidence base and (7) their range of acceptable use, using a scale ranging from 1 (completely disagree) to 9 (completely agree). scores were judged according to the ucla-rand appropriateness method. 
 results: for the six main indications for antibiotic prescribing (acute otitis media, acute upper-respiratory infection, acute/chronic sinusitis, acute tonsillitis, acute bronchitis/bronchiolitis, cystitis/other urinary infection) and for pneumonia, three quality indicators were proposed, the percentage prescribed (a) antibiotics; (b) recommended antibiotics; (c) quinolones. this set was scored by 40 experts from 25 countries. after one scoring round, all indicators were already rated as relevant on all dimensions, except one. 
 conclusion: all proposed disease-specific quality indicators for outpatient antibiotic prescribing have face validity and are potentially applicable. they could be used to better describe antibiotic use and assess the quality of antibiotic prescribing patterns in ambulatory care.

12,41880010,"dendritic cells reduce number and function of cd4(+)cd25(+) cells in cytokine-induced killer cells derived from patients with pancreatic carcinoma. aim and background: cd4(+)cd25(+) cells are described as professional regulatory/suppressor t cells that are crucial for the prevention of spontaneous autoimmune diseases. they play an important role in maintaining a balanced peripheral immune system. on the other hand, it has been suggested that regulatory t cells (treg) suppress antitumor immune responses after tumor-specific vaccinations. therefore, we determined the percentage of regulatory t cells in cytokine-induced killer (cik) cells, an effector cell population with high impact for adoptive immunotherapeutic strategies. results: cik cells showed strong induction of cd4(+)cd25(+) cells with high secretion of interleukin 10 (il-10) after unspecific stimulation of the tcr complex and stimulation with interleukin 2. depletion of cd25(+) cells led to an increase in cytotoxic activity and a reduction of il-10 release. a more pronounced reversal of suppression could be induced by coculture of cik cells with dendritic cells (dcs). after coculture of cik cells with dcs, the number of cd4(+)cd25(+) cells as well as the il-10 concentration in the supernatant decreased, and the cytotoxic activity against pancreatic carcinoma cells increased. this was shown for cells from healthy donors as well as for cells from patients with pancreatic carcinoma. conclusion: our established effector cells possess some regulatory features induced by unspecific tcr-activation that could be prevented by coculture with dcs. cik cells have desirable properties for immunotherapeutical approaches, especially after coculture with dcs, which could be used additionally for induction of a specific immune response.

12,43166413,"gemcitabine selectively eliminates splenic gr-1(+)/cd11b(+) myeloid suppressor cells in tumor-bearing animals and enhances antitumor immune activity. purpose: myeloid suppressor (gr-1(+)/cd11b(+)) cells accumulate in the spleens of tumor-bearing mice where they contribute to immunosuppression by inhibiting the function of cd8(+) tcells and by promoting tumor angiogenesis. elimination of these myeloid suppressor cells may thus significantly improve antitumor responses and enhance effects of cancer immunotherapy, although to. date few practical options exist. 
 experimental design: the effect of the chemotherapy drug gemcitabine on the number of (gr-1(+)/cd11b(+)) cells in the spleens of animals bearing large tumors derived from five cancer lines grown in both c57bi/6 and balb/c mice was analyzed, suppressive activity of splenocytes from gemcitabine-treated and control animals was measured in natural killer (nk) cell lysis and winn assays. the impact of myeloid suppressor cell activity was determined in an immunogene therapy model using an adenovirus expressing ifn-beta. 
 results:this study shows that the chemotherapeutic drug gemcitabine, given at a dose similar to the equivalent dose used in patients, was able to dramatically and specifically reduce the number of-myeloid suppressor cells found in the spleens of animals bearing large tumors with no significant reductions in cdc+ t cells, cd8(+) t cells, nk cells, macrophages, or b cells. the loss of myeloid suppressor cells was accompanied by an increase in the antitumor activity of cd8(+) tcells and activated nk cells. combining gemcitabine with cytokine immunogene therapy using ifn-beta markedly enhanced antitumor efficacy. 
 conclusions: these results suggest that gemcitabine may be a practical strategy for the reduction of myeloid suppressor cells and should be evaluated in conjunction with a variety of immunotherapy approaches.

12,43600649,"sinks, suppressors and antigen presenters: how lymphodepletion enhances t cell-mediated tumor immunotherapy. lymphodepletion followed by adoptive cell transfer (act) of autologous, tumor-reactive t cells boosts antitumor immunotherapeutic activity in mouse and in humans. in the most recent clinical trials, lymphodepletion together with act has an objective response rate of 50% in patients with solid metastatic tumors. the mechanisms underlying this recent advance in cancer immunotherapy are beginning to be elucidated and include: the elimination of cellular cytokine 'sinks' for homeostatic gamma(c)-cytokines, such as interieukin-7 [il-7), il-15 and possibly il-21, which activate and expand tumor-reactive t cells; the impairment of cd4(+)cd25(+) regulatory t (treg) cells that suppress tumor-reactive t cells; and the induction of tumor apoptosis and necrosis in conjunction with antigen-presenting cell activation. knowledge of these factors could be exploited therapeutically to improve the in vivo function of adoptively transferred, tumor-reactive t cells for the treatment of cancer.

12,43759508,"inhibition of cd4(+)25(+) t regulatory cell function implicated in enhanced immune response by low-dose cyclophosphamide. regulatory t cells (t-regs) control the key aspects of tolerance and play a role in the lack of antitumor immune responses. cyclophosphamide (cy) is a chemotherapeutic agent with a dose-dependent, bimodal effect on the immune system. although a previous study demonstrated that cy reduces the number of t-regs, the mechanism involved in this process has yet to be defined. in this report, it is established that low-dose cy not only decreases cell number but leads to decreased functionality of tregs-cy treatment enhances apoptosis and decreases homeostatic proliferation of these cells. expression of gitr and foxp3, which are involved in the suppressive activity of t-regs, is down-regulated after cy administration, though the level of expression varies depending on the time studied. this is the first report demonstrating that cy, in addition to decreasing cell number, inhibits the suppressive capability of t-regs. the relevance of the loss of suppressor functionality and the changes in gene expression are further discussed.

12,43773171,"host lymphodepletion augments t cell adoptive immunotherapy through enhanced intratumorall proliferation of effector cells. t-cell adoptive immunotherapy for stringent murine tumor models, such as intracranial, s.c., or advanced pulmonary metastases, routinely uses lymphodepletive conditioning regimens before t-cell transfer, like recent clinical protocols. in this study, we examined whether host lymphodepletion is an obligatory component of curative t-cell therapy; we also examined the mechanism by which it augments therapy. mice bearing intracranial, s.c., or 10-day pulmonary metastases of mca 205 received total body irradiation conditioning or were nonirradiated before i.v. transfer of tumor-reactive t cells. total body irradiation was not required for immunologically specific curative therapy and induction of memory provided that a 3- to 12-fold higher t-cell dose was administered. the mechanism involved enhanced intratumoral proliferation of t-effector cells in total body irradiation-conditioned recipients. in this tumor model, intratumoral t-reg cells were not detected; consequently, intratumoral t-effector cells produced identical amounts of ifn-gamma upon ex vivo antigen stimulation irrespective of total body irradiation conditioning. thus, host lymphodepletion augments t-cell immunotherapy through enhanced antigen-driven proliferation of t-effector cells, but curative therapy can be achieved in nonconditioned hosts by escalation of t-cell dose. these data provide a rationale for dose escalation of t-effector cells in situations where single or repeated lymphodepletion regimens are contraindicated.

12,44280012,"the dna damage pathway regulates innate immune system ligands of the nkg2d receptor. some stimulatory receptors of the innate immune system, such as the nkg2d receptor ( also called klrk1) expressed by natural killer cells and activated cd8(+) t cells, recognize self-molecules that are upregulated in diseased cells by poorly understood mechanisms(1). here we show that mouse and human nkg2d ligands are upregulated in non-tumour cell lines by genotoxic stress and stalled dna replication, conditions known to activate a major dna damage checkpoint pathway initiated by atm ( ataxia telangiectasia, mutated) or atr (atm- and rad3-related) protein kinases(2). ligand upregulation was prevented by pharmacological or genetic inhibition of atr, atm or chk1 ( a downstream transducer kinase in the pathway). furthermore, constitutive ligand expression by a tumour cell line was inhibited by targeting short interfering rna to atm, suggesting that ligand expression in established tumour cells, which often harbour genomic irregularities, may be due to chronic activation of the dna damage response pathway. thus, the dna damage response, previously shown to arrest the cell cycle and enhance dna repair functions, or to trigger apoptosis, may also participate in alerting the immune system to the presence of potentially dangerous cells.

 patients and methods thirty-five patients with metastatic melanoma, all but one with disease refractory to treatment with high-dose interleukin (il) -2 and many with progressive disease after chemotherapy, underwent lymphodepleting conditioning with two days of cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg) followed by five days of fludarabine (25 mg/m(2)). on the day following the final dose of fludarabine, all patients received cell infusion with autologous tumor-reactive, rapidly expanded tumor infiltrating lymphocyte cultures and high-dose il-2 therapy. 
 results eighteen (51 %) of 35 treated patients experienced objective clinical responses including three ongoing complete responses and 15 partial responses with a mean duration of 11.5 +/- 2.2 months. sites of regression included metastases to lung, liver, lymph nodes, brain, and cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues. toxicities of treatment included the expected hematologic toxicities of chemotherapy including neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia, the transient toxicities of high-dose il-2 therapy, two patients who developed pneumocystis pneumonia and one patient who developed an epstein-barr virus-related lymphoproliferation.

12,44872545,"the dna damage response arouses the immune system. although there is considerable knowledge of how dna damage triggers cell cycle arrest, dna repair, and apoptosis, little was known about its potential role in immune responses. recently, we showed that genotoxic stress and stalled dna replication forks induce the expression of ligands for the nkg2d receptor found in natural killer cells and certain t cells, cell types that are able to attack tumor cells. chronic activation of this response in tumor cells may contribute to immune recognition, but it also imposes a selection mechanism for immune escape and malignant progression. this unique arm of the dna damage response may have implications for understanding therapeutic responses, many of which induce the dna damage response, and for designing more effective regimens to treat cancer.

12,45708451,"bcl-2 antisense (oblimersen sodium) plus dacarbazine in patients with advanced melanoma: the oblimersen melanoma study group. purpose 
 chemotherapy resistance in melanoma has been linked to antiapoptotic effects mediated by bcl-2 protein. we evaluated whether targeting bcl-2 using an antisense oligonucleotide (oblimersen sodium) could improve the efficacy of systemic chemotherapy in patients with advanced melanoma. 
 patients and methods 
 we randomly assigned chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced melanoma to treatment with dacarbazine ( 1,000 mg/m(2)) alone or preceded by a 5-day continuous intravenous infusion of oblimersen sodium ( 7 mg/kg/d) every 3 weeks for up to eight cycles. patients were stratified by eastern cooperative oncology group performance status, liver metastases, disease site, and serum lactate dehydrogenase (ldh). the primary efficacy end point was overall survival. 
 results 
 among 771 patients randomly assigned, the addition of oblimersen to dacarbazine yielded a trend toward improved survival at 24-month minimum follow-up ( median, 9.0 v 7.8 months; p =.077) and significant increases in progression-free survival ( median, 2.6 v 1.6 months; p &amp;lt;.001), overall response ( 13.5% v 7.5%; p =.007), complete response (2.8% v 0.8%), and durable response (7.3% v 3.6%; p =.03). a significant interaction between baseline serum ldh and treatment was observed; oblimersen significantly increased survival in patients whose baseline serum ldh was not elevated ( median overall survival, 11.4 v 9.7 months; p =.02). neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were increased in the oblimersen-dacarbazine group; however, there was no increase in serious infections or bleeding events. 
 conclusion 
 the addition of oblimersen to dacarbazine significantly improved multiple clinical outcomes in patients with advanced melanoma and increased overall survival in patients without an elevated baseline serum ldh.

 design and methods eleven patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (n=4), hodgkin's disease (n=3), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, (n=1), pre-b acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=1) and myelodysplasia (n=2), all of whom had relapsed after sibling (n=6) or matched unrelated donor (n=5) hsct, entered this study. 
 results before cik administration, six patients had received other salvage treatments including chemotherapy (n=5), radiotherapy (n=1) and unmanipulated donor lymphocytes (n=6) without any significant tumor response. the median number of cik infusions was two (range 1-7) and the median number of total cik cells was 12.4 x10(6)/kg (range 7.2-87.4). the infusions were well tolerated and no acute or late infusion-related reactions were recorded. acute gvhd (grade i and ii) was observed in four patients, 30 days after the last cik infusion, and progressed into extensive chronic gvhd in two cases. disease progression and death occurred in six patients. one patient had stable disease, one had hematologic improvement and three achieved complete responses.

12,47882814,"cyclophosphamide enhances the antitumor efficacy of adoptively transferred immune cells through the induction of cytokine expression, b-cell and t-cell homeostatic proliferation, and specific tumor infiltration. purpose: immunotherapy is a promising antitumor strategy, which can be successfully combined with current anticancer treatments, as suggested by recent studies showing the paradoxical chemotherapy-induced enhancement of the immune response. the purpose of the present work is to dissect the biological events induced by chemotherapy that cooperate with immunotherapy in the success of the combined treatment against cancer. in particular, we focused on the following: (a) cyclophosphamide-induced modulation of several cytokines, (b) homeostatic proliferation of adoptively transferred lymphocytes, and (c) homing of transferred lymphocytes to secondary lymphoid organs and tumor mass. 
 experimental design: here, we used the adoptive transfer of tumor-immune cells after cyclophosphamide treatment of tumor-bearing mice as a model to elucidate the mechanisms by which cyclophosphamide can render the immune lymphocytes competent to induce tumor rejection. 
 results: the transfer of antitumor immunity was found to be dependent on cd4(+) t cells and on the cooperation of adoptively transferred cells with the host immune system. of note, tumor-immune lymphocytes migrated specifically to the tumor only in mice pretreated with cyclophosphamide. cyclophosphamide treatment also promoted homeostatic proliferation/activation of transferred b and t lymphocytes. optimal therapeutic responses to the transfer of immune cells were associated with the cyclophosphamide-mediated induction of a cytokine storm [including granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin (il)-1 beta, il-7, il-15, il-2, il-21, and ifn-gamma], occurring during the rebound phase after drug-induced lymphodepletion. 
 conclusions: the ensemble of these data provides a new rationale for combining immunotherapy and chemotherapy to induce an effective antitumor response in cancer patients.

 experimental design: animals bearing hpv e6/e7-expressing tumors were treated intratumorally with a selected cytotoxic drug, cisplatin, twice at 1-week interval and s.c. with e7 subunit vaccines thrice at 1-week interval. tumor chemoimmunoresponse was measured by tumor size. ag-specific ctl activities and tumor histology were checked in mice under treatments. apoptosis, in vivo t-cell subset depletion, adoptive ctl transfer, and tumor regression were used to determine the mechanisms for antitumor therapeutic effects, 
 results: combined therapy using cisplatin plus e7 subunit vaccines improved cure and recurrence rates of tumors and long-term antitumor immunity dramatically more than single therapy alone. in particular, both components of e7 subunit vaccines were required for induction of ag-specific ctl as well as therapeutic synergy when combined with cisplatin. this therapeutic synergy was abrogated by depletion of cd8(+) t cells in vivo and was concomitant with histologic changes (such as heavy infiltration of lymphocytes and reduced tumor cell density). finally, the increased sensitivity of cisplatin-treated tumors to ctl-mediated killing was found to be responsible for therapeutic synergy. 
 conclusions: e7 subunit vaccines plus cisplatin mediate antitumor therapeutic synergy through the increased sensitivity of cisplatin-treated tumors to ctl-mediated killing. moreover, e7-based therapeutic vaccines have the potential to improve chemotherapy in patients with cervical cancer.

12,53565119,"myeloid-derived suppressor cells: more mechanisms for inhibiting antitumor immunity. myeloid-derived suppressor cells (mdsc) accumulate in most cancer patients and experimental animals with cancer. they accumulate in response to pro-inflammatory mediators and they use a variety of mechanisms to block both innate and adaptive antitumor immunity. because of their critical role in obstructing immune responses, mdsc are a strategic obstacle to immunotherapies that require activation of the host&amp;apos;s cell-mediated and innate immune responses. following a brief description of the factors that induce mdsc accumulation, this article reviews two newly discovered mechanisms that mdsc use to suppress the activation of cd4(+) and cd8(+) t cells. the first mechanism is mdsc sequestration of cysteine, an amino acid that t cells are unable to synthesize de novo and that they require for activation. the second mechanism is mdsc-mediated down-regulation of l-selectin. t cells must have an l-selectin(high) phenotype to home to lymph nodes and inflammatory sites where they encounter antigen and are activated. by down-regulating l-selectin on t cells, mdsc perturb t cell trafficking patterns and thereby inhibit t cell activation. given the complexity of conditions that regulate mdsc accumulation and the variety of suppressive mechanisms used by mdsc, it is essential to understand which conditions and mechanisms are dominant so mdsc accumulation and/or activity can be targeted in individual patients to minimize mdsc-induced immune suppression.

12,53666286,"5-fluorouracil selectively kills tumor-associated myeloid-derived suppressor cells resulting in enhanced t cell-dependent antitumor immunity. myeloid-derived suppressor cells (mdsc) accumulate in the spleen and tumor bed during tumor growth. they contribute to the immune tolerance of cancer notably by inhibiting the function of cd8 (+) t cells. thus, their elimination may hamper tumor growth by enhancing antitumor t-cell functions. we have previously reported that some anticancer agents relied on t cell-dependent anticancer responses to achieve maximal efficacy. however, the effect of anticancer agents on mdsc has remained largely unexplored. in this study, we observed that gemcitabine and 5-fluorouracil (5fu) were selectively cytotoxic on mdsc. in vivo, the treatment of tumor-bearing mice with 5fu led to a major decrease in the number of mdsc in the spleens and tumor beds of animals whereas no significant effect on t cells, natural killer cells, dendritic cells, or b cells was noted. interestingly, 5fu showed a stronger efficacy over gemcitabine to deplete mdsc and selectively induced mdsc apoptotic cell death in vitro and in vivo. the elimination of mdsc by 5fu increased ifn-gamma production by tumor-specific cd8(+) t cells infiltrating the tumor and promoted t cell-dependent antitumor responses in vivo. altogether, these findings suggest that the antitumor effect of 5fu is mediated, at least in part, by its selective cytotoxic action on mdsc. cancer res; 70(8); 3052-61.

 methods: tumor size and weight served as indicators of therapeutic response. immunohistochemistry was performed to observe intratumoral lymphocyte infiltration and tumor microvessel density. changes in the percentage of regulatory t (treg) cells within the spleens of tumor-bearing mice preconditioned with ddp were monitored using flow cytometry. 
 results: a marked t cell-dependent, synergistic antitumor effect of the combined therapy was observed (1968 +/- 491 mm(3) vs 3872 +/- 216 mm(3); p = 0.003). preconditioning chemotherapy with ddp augmented the infiltration of cd3+ t lymphocytes into the tumor mass and reduced the percentage of both intratumoral and splenic treg cells.

 methods twenty-eight untreated patients suffered from iiib to iv nsclc were enrolled in the study between august 2004 and october 2005, and all received four courses of vinorelbine-platinum (np) chemotherapy. fourteen of them received conventional np chemotherapy followed by vaccinated with cea (605-613) peptide-pulsed autologous dendritic cells and cik cells. vaccination was repeated at 30-day intervals for 4 cycles. the adverse effects, time to progression (ttp), and overall survival (os) in each group were evaluated. 
 results the adverse effect as a result of chemoimmunotherapy was mild and tolerable. rash, acne, and pruritus were more frequent in the chemoimmunotherapy group than in the chemotherapy group (64.2% vs. 7.1%, p = 0.004). non-infectious fever was more frequent in the chemoimmunotherapy group than in the chemotherapy group (71.4% vs. 21.4% p = 0.02). less grade 3/4 fatigue was observed in patients receiving chemoimmunotherapy: 7.1% versus 57.1% in chemotherapy group, p = 0.01. compared with patients in chemotherapy group, time to progression in chemoimmunotherapy significantly prolonged, with the median improved from 5.2 months (95% ci: 3.3-6.0) to 6.9 months (95% ci: 5.0-8.8) (p = 0.03). the 1-, 2-, and 5-year survival rates were 64.3, 49, and 21.0%, respectively in chemoimmunotherapy group. overall survival rate showed no statistically difference between two groups (p = 0.18).

 phase 1 and 2 clinical trials of the braf kinase inhibitor vemurafenib (plx4032) have shown response rates of more than 50% in patients with metastatic melanoma with the braf v600e mutation. 
 methods 
 we conducted a phase 3 randomized clinical trial comparing vemurafenib with dacarbazine in 675 patients with previously untreated, metastatic melanoma with the braf v600e mutation. patients were randomly assigned to receive either vemurafenib (960 mg orally twice daily) or dacarbazine (1000 mg per square meter of body-surface area intravenously every 3 weeks). coprimary end points were rates of overall and progression-free survival. secondary end points included the response rate, response duration, and safety. a final analysis was planned after 196 deaths and an interim analysis after 98 deaths. 
 results 
 at 6 months, overall survival was 84% (95% confidence interval [ci], 78 to 89) in the vemurafenib group and 64% (95% ci, 56 to 73) in the dacarbazine group. in the interim analysis for overall survival and final analysis for progression-free survival, vemurafenib was associated with a relative reduction of 63% in the risk of death and of 74% in the risk of either death or disease progression, as compared with dacarbazine (p &amp;lt; 0.001 for both comparisons). after review of the interim analysis by an independent data and safety monitoring board, crossover from dacarbazine to vemurafenib was recommended. response rates were 48% for vemurafenib and 5% for dacarbazine. common adverse events associated with vemurafenib were arthralgia, rash, fatigue, alopecia, keratoacanthoma or squamous-cell carcinoma, photosensitivity, nausea, and diarrhea; 38% of patients required dose modification because of toxic effects.

14,47508428,"pressure-controlled ventilation is superior to volume-controlled ventilation with a laryngeal mask airway in children. background: this prospective, randomized, crossover study had two purposes: first, to determine whether pressure-controlled ventilation (pcv) is safer than volume-controlled ventilation (vcv) by preventing gastric insufflation in children ventilated through an laryngeal mask airway (lma); second, to assess whether the measurement of lma leak pressure (p-leak) is useful for preventing leakage during positive pressure ventilation (ppv). 
 methods: forty-one, 2 to 15-year-old children underwent general anesthesia with an lma. the expiratory valve was set at 30 cmh(2)o and p-leak was measured using constant gas flow. children were randomly ventilated using pcv or vcv for 5 min in order to reach a petco2 not exceeding 45 mm hg, and then they were ventilated with the alternative mode. if the target petco2 could not be obtained in one mode, we switched to the other. if both modes failed, children were intubated. tidal volumes, petco2 and airway pressures were noted and compared between modes. gastric insufflation was checked by epigastric auscultation. 
 results: pcv provided more efficient ventilation than vcv, as targeted petco2 was obtained without gastric insufflation using pcv in all cases except one, whereas vcv failed in three cases. no gastric insufflation occurred when ventilating below peak. 
 conclusions: these findings suggest that in the age group studied, pcv is more efficient than vcv for controlled ventilation with a laryngeal mask. gastric insufflation did not occur with this mode.

 methods: we studied 41 patients scheduled for thoracoscopy surgery. after initial two-lung ventilation with vcv patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups. in one group olv was started with vcv (tidal volume 6 ml/kg, peep 5) and after 30 minutes ventilation was switched to pcv (inspiratory pressure to provide a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg, peep 5) for the same time period. in the second group, ventilation modes were performed in reverse order. airway pressures and blood gases were obtained at the end of each ventilatory mode. 
 results: pao(2), paco(2) and alveolar-arterial oxygen difference did not differ between pcv and vcv. peak airway pressure was significantly lower in pcv compared with vcv (19.9 +/- 3.8 cmh(2)o vs 23.1 +/- 4.3 cmh(2)o; p &amp;lt; 0.001) without any significant differences in mean and plateau pressures.

17,526959,"precision modelling of m dwarf stars: the magnetic components of cm draconis. the eclipsing binary cm draconis (cm dra) contains two nearly identical red dwarfs of spectral class dm4.5. the masses and radii of the two components have been reported with unprecedentedly small statistical errors: for m, these errors are 1 part in 260, while for r, the errors reported by morales et al. are 1 part in 130. when compared with standard stellar models with appropriate mass and age (approximate to 4 gyr), the empirical results indicate that both components are discrepant from the models in the following sense: the observed stars are larger in r (bloated), by several standard deviations, than the models predict. the observed luminosities are also lower than the models predict. here, we attempt at first to model the two components of cm dra in the context of standard (non-magnetic) stellar models using a systematic array of different assumptions about helium abundances (y), heavy element abundances (z), opacities and mixing length parameter (a). we find no 4-gyr-old models with plausible values of these four parameters that fit the observed l and r within the reported statistical error bars. 
 however, cm dra is known to contain magnetic fields, as evidenced by the occurrence of star-spots and flares. here we ask: can inclusion of magnetic effects into stellar evolution models lead to fits of l and r within the error bars? morales et al. have reported that the presence of polar spots results in a systematic overestimate of r by a few per cent when eclipses are interpreted with a standard code. in a star where spots cover a fraction f of the surface area, we find that the revised r and l for cm dra a can be fitted within the error bars by varying the parameter a. the latter is often assumed to be reduced by the presence of magnetic fields, although the reduction in alpha as a function of b is difficult to quantify. an alternative magnetic effect, namely inhibition of the onset of convection, can be readily quantified in terms of a magnetic parameter delta approximate to b-2/4p gamma p(gas) (where b is the strength of the local vertical magnetic field). in the context of delta models in which b is not allowed to exceed a 'ceiling' of 10(6) g, we find that the revised r and l can also be fitted, within the error bars, in a finite region of the f-delta plane. the permitted values of delta near the surface leads us to estimate that the vertical field strength on the surface of cm dra a is about 500 g, in good agreement with independent observational evidence for similar low-mass stars. recent results for another binary with parameters close to those of cm dra suggest that metallicity differences cannot be the dominant explanation for the bloating of the two components of cm dra.

17,45677057,"discovery of two young brown dwarfs in an eclipsing binary system. brown dwarfs are considered to be ' failed stars' in the sense that they are born with masses between the least massive stars ( 0.072 solar masses, m.)(1) and the most massive planets ( similar to 0.013m.)(2); they therefore serve as a critical link in our understanding of the formation of both stars and planets(3). even the most fundamental physical properties of brown dwarfs remain, however, largely unconstrained by direct measurement. here we report the discovery of a brown- dwarf eclipsing binary system, in the orion nebula star- forming region, from which we obtain direct measurements of mass and radius for these newly formed brown dwarfs. our mass measurements establish both objects as brown dwarfs, with masses of 0.054 +/- 0.005m. and 0.034 +/- 0.003m. at the same time, with radii relative to the sun's of 0.669 +/- 0.034r. and 0.511 +/- 0.026r., these brown dwarfs are more akin to low- mass stars in size. such large radii are generally consistent with theoretical predictions for young brown dwarfs in the earliest stages of gravitational contraction(4,5). surprisingly, however, we find that the less- massive brown dwarf is the hotter of the pair; this result is contrary to the predictions of all current theoretical models of coeval brown dwarfs.

17,46849488,"a surprising reversal of temperatures in the brown dwarf eclipsing binary 2mass j05352184-0546085. the newly discovered brown dwarf eclipsing binary 2mass j05352184-0546085 provides a unique laboratory for testing the predictions of theoretical models of brown dwarf formation and evolution. the finding that the lower mass brown dwarf in this system is hotter than its higher mass companion represents a challenge to brown dwarf evolutionary models, none of which predict this behavior. here we present updated determinations of the basic physical properties of 2m0535-05, bolstering the surprising reversal of temperatures with mass in this system. we compare these measurements with widely used brown dwarf evolutionary tracks, and find that the temperature reversal can be explained by some models if the components of 2m0535-05 are mildly non-coeval, possibly consistent with dynamical simulations of brown dwarf formation. alternatively, a strong magnetic field on the higher mass brown dwarf might explain its anomalously low surface temperature, consistent with emerging evidence that convection is suppressed in magnetically active, low-mass stars. finally, we discuss future observational and theoretical work needed to further characterize and understand this benchmark system.

17,47762372,"detection of strong activity in the eclipsing binary brown dwarf 2mass j05352184-0546085: a possible explanation for the temperature reversal. we show high-resolution spectra of the eclipsing brown dwarf binary 2mass j05352184 - 0546085 taken at the two opposite radial velocity maxima. comparisons of the tio bands to model and template spectra are fully consistent with the temperatures previously derived for this system. in particular, the reversal of temperatures with mass - in which the higher mass primary is cooler than its companion - is confirmed. we measure the projected rotation velocities of the components; the primary is rotating at least twice as rapidly as the secondary. at the two radial velocity maxima, h alpha emission lines of both components stick out to either sides of the h alpha central wavelength, which is dominated by nebula emission. this enables us to model the individual h alpha lines of the primary and the secondary. we find that the h alpha emission from the primary is at least 7 times stronger than the emission from the secondary. we conclude that the temperature reversal is very likely due to strong magnetic fields inhibiting convection on the primary.

17,48474076,"simulations of dynamo action in fully convective stars. we present three-dimensional nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the interiors of fully convective m dwarfs. our models consider 0.3 solar-mass stars using the anelastic spherical harmonic code, with the spherical computational domain extending from 0.08 to 0.96 times the overall stellar radius. like previous authors, we find that fully convective stars can generate kg-strength magnetic fields ( in rough equipartition with the convective flows) without the aid of a tachocline of shear. although our model stars are everywhere unstably stratified, the amplitudes and typical pattern sizes of the convective flows vary strongly with radius, with the outer regions of the stars hosting vigorous convection and field amplification while the deep interiors are more quiescent. modest differential rotation is established in hydrodynamic calculations, but - unlike in some prior work - strongly quenched in mhd simulations because of the maxwell stresses exerted by the dynamo-generated magnetic fields. despite the lack of strong differential rotation, the magnetic fields realized in the simulations possess significant mean (axisymmetric) components, which we attribute partly to the strong influence of rotation on the slowly overturning flows.

17,49689113,"the effect of activity on stellar temperatures and radii. context. recent analyses of low-mass eclipsing binary stars have unveiled a significant disagreement between the observations and predictions of stellar structure models. results show that theoretical models underestimate the radii and overestimate the effective temperatures of low-mass stars but yield luminosities that accord with observations. a hypothesis based upon the effects of stellar activity was put forward to explain the discrepancies. 
 aims. in this paper we study the existence of the same trend in single active stars and provide a consistent scenario to explain systematic differences between active and inactive stars in the h-r diagram reported earlier. 
 methods. the analysis is done using single field stars of spectral types late-k and m and computing their bolometric magnitudes and temperatures through infrared colours and spectral indices. the properties of the stars in samples of active and inactive stars are compared statistically to reveal systematic differences. 
 results. after accounting for a number of possible bias effects, active stars are shown to be cooler than inactive stars of similar luminosity therefore implying a larger radius as well, in proportions that are in excellent agreement with those found from eclipsing binaries. 
 conclusions. the present results generalise the existence of strong radius and temperature dependences on stellar activity to the entire population of low-mass stars, regardless of their membership in close binary systems.

17,51579361,"structural effects of magnetic fields in brown dwarfs. in the brown dwarf (bd) binary 2m0535-05, stassun et al. have reported that the more massive primary has a lower t(eff) than the less massive secondary. here, we report results obtained by an evolutionary code in which the criterion for the onset of convection in the primary is modified in the presence of a magnetic field. structural alterations to the primary lead to a lower t(eff) and a larger radius than would occur in a non-magnetic bd of the same age mass and age. the observed value of t(eff) can be explained if the field in the primary increases in strength from 120-320 g at the surface to 5-13 mg at the center. with zero field in the secondary, our models indicate that both components can be co-eval with an age of 1.0-1.3 myr. because the binary is so young, the components have not yet had time to synchronize their rotations: differences in angular velocity may explain why one component has developed a field while the other has not.

18,591395,"quantitative dna methylation analysis identifies a single cpg dinucleotide important for zap-70 expression and predictive of prognosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. purpose 
 increased zap-70 expression predicts poor prognosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll). current methods for accurately measuring zap-70 expression are problematic, preventing widespread application of these tests in clinical decision making. we therefore used comprehensive dna methylation profiling of the zap-70 regulatory region to identify sites important for transcriptional control. 
 patients and methods 
 high-resolution quantitative dna methylation analysis of the entire zap-70 gene regulatory regions was conducted on 247 samples from patients with cll from four independent clinical studies. 
 results 
 through this comprehensive analysis, we identified a small area in the 5' regulatory region of zap-70 that showed large variability in methylation in cll samples but was universally methylated in normal b cells. high correlation with mrna and protein expression, as well as activity in promoter reporter assays, revealed that within this differentially methylated region, a single cpg dinucleotide and neighboring nucleotides are particularly important in zap-70 transcriptional regulation. furthermore, by using clustering approaches, we identified a prognostic role for this site in four independent data sets of patients with cll using time to treatment, progression-free survival, and overall survival as clinical end points. 
 conclusion 
 comprehensive quantitative dna methylation analysis of the zap-70 gene in cll identified important regions responsible for transcriptional regulation. in addition, loss of methylation at a specific single cpg dinucleotide in the zap-70 5' regulatory sequence is a highly predictive and reproducible biomarker of poor prognosis in this disease. this work demonstrates the feasibility of using quantitative specific zap-70 methylation analysis as a relevant clinically applicable prognostic test in cll.

18,30692095,"dna methylation does not stably lock gene expression but instead serves as a molecular mark for gene silencing memory. dna methylation is commonly thought of as a molecular lock that leads to permanent gene silencing. to investigate this notion, we tested 24 different histone deacetylase inhibitors (hdaci) on colon cancer cells that harbor a gfp locus stably integrated and silenced by a hypermethylated cytomegalovirus (cmv) promoter. we found that hdaci efficiently reactivated expression of gfp and many other endogenous genes silenced by dna hypermethylation. after treatment, all promoters were marked with active chromatin, yet dna hypermethylation did not change. thus, dna methylation could not prevent gene reactivation by drug-induced resetting of the chromatin state. in evaluating the relative contribution of dna methylation and histone modifications to stable gene silencing, we followed expression levels of gfp and other genes silenced by dna hypermethylation over time after treatment with hdaci or dna-demethylating drugs. reactivation of methylated loci by hdaci was detectable for only 2 weeks, whereas dna-demethylating drugs induced permanent epigenetic reprogramming. therefore, dna methylation cannot be considered as a lock for gene expression but rather as a memory signal for long-term maintenance of gene silencing. these findings define chromatin as an important druggable target for cancer epigenetic therapy and suggest that removal of dna methylation signals is required to achieve long-term gene reactivation. cancer res; 72(5); 1170-81.

 epigenetic silencing of the mgmt (o(sup 6)-methylguanine-dna methyltransferase) dna-repair gene by promoter methylation compromises dna repair and has been associated with longer survival in patients with glioblastoma who receive alkylating agents. 
 methods: 
 we tested the relationship between mgmt silencing in the tumor and the survival of patients who were enrolled in a randomized trial comparing radiotherapy alone with radiotherapy combined with concomitant and adjuvant treatment with temozolomide. the methylation status of the mgmt promoter was determined by methylation-specific polymerase-chain-reaction analysis. 
 results: 
 the mgmt promoter was methylated in 45 percent of 206 assessable cases. irrespective of treatment, mgmt promoter methylation was an independent favorable prognostic factor (p&amp;lt;0.001 by the log-rank test; hazard ratio, 0.45; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.32 to 0.61). among patients whose tumor contained a methylated mgmt promoter, a survival benefit was observed in patients treated with temozolomide and radiotherapy; their median survival was 21.7 months (95 percent confidence interval, 17.4 to 30.4), as compared with 15.3 months (95 percent confidence interval, 13.0 to 20.9) among those who were assigned to only radiotherapy (p=0.007 by the log-rank test). in the absence of methylation of the mgmt promoter, there was a smaller and statistically insignificant difference in survival between the treatment groups.

 patients with glioblastoma containing a methylated mgmt promoter benefited from temozolomide, whereas those who did not have a methylated mgmt promoter did not have such a benefit.

 results: febrile neutropenia was dose limiting. one thymoma patient responded. decitabine decreased tumor dna methylation (from median 51.2% predecitabine to 43.7% postdecitabine; p=0.01, with effects at all doses) and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (from 65.3-56.0%). there was no correlation between tumor and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. patients starting clecitabine &amp;lt;= 2 versus &amp;gt;3 months after last prior cytotoxic or targeted therapy had lower predecitabine tumor ctr1 scores (p=0.02), higher p16 (p=0.04), and trends (p=0.07) toward higher tumor methylation and apoptosis. decitabine decreased tumor dnmt1 for scores initially &amp;gt;0 (p = 0.04). decitabine increased tumor apoptosis (p &amp;lt; 0.05), mitoses (if initially low, p = 0.02), and ctr1 (if initially low, p = 0.025, or if &amp;lt;= 3 months from last prior therapy, p = 0.04). tumor ctr1 scores correlated inversely with methylation (r = -0.41, p = 0.005), but ctr1 promoter was not hypermethylated. only three patients had tumor p16 promoter hypermethylation. p16 scores did not increase. higher blood pressure correlated with lower tumor necrosis (p = 0.03) and a trend toward greater dna demethylation (p = 0.10). 
 conclusions: exposure to various cytotoxic and targeted agents might generate broad pleiotropic resistance by reducing ctr1 and other transporters. decitabine decreases dna methylation and augments ctr1 expression through methylation-independent mechanisms.

18,52965137,"dna methylation predicts survival and response to therapy in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. purpose 
 the current classification systems of myelodysplastic syndromes (mds), including the international prognostic scoring system (ipss), do not fully reflect the molecular heterogeneity of the disease. molecular characterization may predict clinical outcome and help stratify patients for targeted therapies. epigenetic therapy using decitabine, a dna hypomethylating agent, is clinically effective for the treatment of mds. therefore, we investigated the association between dna methylation and clinical outcome in mds. 
 patients and methods 
 we screened 24 patients with mds for promoter cpg island methylation of 24 genes and identified aberrant hypermethylation at 10 genes. we then performed quantitative methylation analyses by bisulfite pyrosequencing of the identified genes in 317 patient samples from three independent studies and assessed relations between methylation and clinical outcome. 
 results 
 in an initial training cohort of 89 patients with mds, methylation frequencies of individual genes ranged from 7% to 70% and were highly concordant. therefore, we defined a methylation z score based on all genes for each patient. we found that patients with higher levels of methylation, compared with patients with lower levels, had a shorter median overall survival (12.3 v 17.5 months, respectively; p = .04) and shorter median progression-free survival (6.4 v 14.9 months, respectively; p = .009). this methylation prognostic model was independent of age, sex, and ipss group. applied to two validation cohorts (228 patients), this model was confirmed as an independent prognostic predictor for survival. although methylation at baseline did not correlate with clinical response to decitabine, we observed a significant correlation between reduced methylation over time and clinical responses. 
 conclusion 
 dna methylation predicts overall and progression-free survival in mds.

20,2215935,"effect of gamma radiation on morphological, biochemical, and physiological aspects of plants and plant products. research on the basic interaction of radiation with biological systems has contributed to human society through various applications in medicine, agriculture, pharmaceuticals and in other technological developments. in the agricultural sciences and food technology sectors, recent research has elucidated the new potential application of radiation for microbial decontamination due to the inhibitory effect of radiation on microbial infestation. the last few decades have witnessed a large number of pertinent works regarding the utilization of radiation with special interest in gamma-rays for evolution of superior varieties of agricultural crops of economic importance. in this review, general information will be presented about radiation, such as plant specificity, dose response, beneficial effects, and lethality. a comparison of different studies has clarified how the effects observed after exposure were deeply influenced by several factors, some related to plant characteristics (e. g., species, cultivar, stage of development, tissue architecture, and genome organization) and some related to radiation features (e. g., quality, dose, duration of exposure). there are many beneficial uses of radiation that offer few risks when properly employed. in this review, we report the main results from studies on the effect of gamma-irradiations on plants, focusing on metabolic alterations, modifications of growth and development, and changes in biochemical pathways especially physiological behaviour.

20,34404402,"involvement of peroxidase in differential sensitivity to gamma-radiation in seedlings of two nicotiana species. mechanisms underlying differential radiosensitivity were investigated using seeds and seedlings from two nicotiana species, nicotiana debneyi and nicotiana tabacum with co-60 gamma-radiation up to 500 gy. a contrasting response to radiation was found between the seeds and seedlings in these species. seeds were more radiosensitive in n. debneyi than in n. tabacum with respect to germination rate and subsequent seedling development. conversely, irradiation of seedlings damaged n. tabacum more than n. debneyi, as revealed by inhibition of further seedling growth, chlorophyll degradation, and abnormalities in morphology. subsequent experiments on seedlings revealed that the amount of the radical, oh., generated in irradiated tissues did not appear to differ between the species or with increasing doses of gamma-radiation and that endogenous antioxidants which might eliminate radicals non-enzymatically were not altered by irradiation in either species irrespective of radiation doses. although radiation induced increases in the activities of some antioxidant enzymes (peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase) and changed isozyme patterns, none of these features could explain the difference in response to radiation in these plants. however, activity of peroxidase in non-irradiated tissues was 5-fold higher in n. debneyi than in n. tabacum. it was thus suggested that the difference in response to radiation between these two species was ascribed to the difference in the potential activity of this enzyme to remove toxic hydrogen peroxide which was produced in irradiated tissues.

 methods phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (pal), phenylpropanoids and peroxidases (pod) were investigated in elicited cassava suspension cells and leaves. yeast elicitor was the most effective of several microbial and endogenous elicitors. fungitoxicity was determined against the cassava pathogens fusarium solani, f. oxysporum and the saprotroph trichoderma harzianum. 
 key results a single and rapid (greater than or equal to2-3 min) oxidative burst, measured as hydrogen peroxide, occurred in elicited cells. pal activity was induced maximally at 15 h and was preceded by pal mrna accumulation, which peaked at 9 h. symplasmic pod activity increased four-fold in cells, 48 it post-elicitation. pod isoforms (2-7 isoforms, pi 3.1-8-8) were detected in elicited and unelicited cells, extracellular medium and leaves but two extracellular isoforms were enhanced post-elicitation. also expression of a cassava peroxidase gene mecpod1 increased in elicited cells. only anionic forms oxidized scopoletin, with highest activity by isoform, pl 3.6, present in all samples. unidentified phenolics and possibly scopolin increased post-elicitation, but there was no enhancement of scopoletin, rutin or kaempferol-3-o-rutinoside concentration. fungal germ tube elongation was inhibited more than germination by esculetin, ferulic acid, quercetin and scopoletin. t. harzianum was generally more sensitive than the pathogens and was inhibited by greater than or equal to50 mug ml(-1) of ferulic acid and quercetin and greater than or equal to10 mug ml(-1) of scopoletin. 
 conclusions phenolic levels in cells were not enhanced and were, theoretically, too low to be inhibitory. however, in combination and when oxidized they may contribute to defence, because oxidation of esculetin and scopoletin by peroxidase and of esculetin by tyrosinase enhanced their fungitoxicity up to 20-fold.
