734,"overentrant swelling behaviour of poly(potassium, 3-sulfopropyl acrylate-acrylic acid) gels. rarely observed in hydrogels, overentrant is referred to an unusual swelling behaviour in which swelling in mixed solvents is higher than in the pure solvent with a higher dielectric constant. hydrogels based on acrylic acid (aa) and 3-sulfopropyl acrylate, potassium salt (kspa) were prepared to track this behaviour. the poly(kspa-aa) products were then treated with hcl to prepare poly (spa-aa) hydrogels. the overentrant behaviour of poly (spa-aa) was examined in binary mixture of water and various polar solvents including dimethyl sulfoxide (dmso), mono-and poly-hydric alcohols as well as amide solvents. it was observed that poly(spa-aa) showed overentrant swelling behaviour in aqueous solvents such as methanol, ethanol, glycerol, etc. to characterize non-treated and treated samples, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir), thermogravimetric analysis (tga), and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (dmta) analyses were utilized for the dried samples. rheometrical testing was also employed to evaluate the modulus of the swollen samples. the structure-property relationship was preliminarily discussed. dielectric constant and hydrogen bonding formation potential of the solvents were expected to be of the main causes of the extraordinary swelling behaviour.

735,"indoor air quality monitoring improving air quality perception. energy-efficient ventilation strategies relating to good indoor air quality (iaq) are a major task for building performance according to the requirements set by the energy performance of buildings directive (epbd) in 2010. applying demand-controlled ventilation (dcv) in buildings, using sensors for iaq control that enables variable airflow rates adapted to the actual indoor load conditions is one possibility to fulfill the requirements of adequate iaq while reducing the energy consumption at the same time. co2 concentrations above outdoors are generally used as an indicator for occupancy generated indoor air pollution and corresponding ventilation rates. the objective of this study is focused on a micromachined metal oxide semiconductor gas sensor module developed for iaq control, based on volatile organic compound (voc) detection. the sensor output was correlated with measured co2 concentrations and quantified vocs in 15 field scenarios. energy demand and iaq, applying the sensor module for dcv in an office, were compared to natural and time-scheduled ventilation in the office. the study accentuates the need for dcv and proves the functionality of the sensor module for iaq control at adequate comfort levels. compared to time-scheduled ventilation, 15% heating energy and 70% power consumption were saved with dcv.

740,"importance of nutritional support in patients with hepatic encephalopathy. protein calorie malnutrition is frequently a complication in the chronic liver disease patient and is considered to be a negative prognostic factor. anorexia and several other endocrine metabolic complications produce an hypermetabolic state that needs more caloric intake. hepatic encephalopathy is one of the developments possible in patients with descompensated cirrhosis. the well-known role of ammonia in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy has determined a restriction in dietary protein along many decades. nevertheless, there is no evidence about a low protein diet being better in the outcome of hepatic encephalopathy, it worsens, moreover, the nutritional status and helps in the development of many nutritional related complications. this article reviews the use of oral branched-chain amino acids and proteins of different sources, probiotics, synbiotics, antioxidants, oral l-ornithine l-aspartate and acetyl-l-carnitine in patients with hepatic encephalopathy.

741,"preservation of the hyperdirect pathway of basal ganglia in a rodent brain slice. basal ganglia are a network of interconnected nuclei, involved in motor control, goal-directed behaviors and procedural learning. basal ganglia process information from the cerebral cortex through three main pathways. the striatum is the input nucleus of the direct (cortico-striato-nigral) and indirect (cortico-striato-pallido-subthalamo-nigral) pathways while the subthalamic nucleus (stn) is the input structure of the hyperdirect (cortico-subthalamo-nigral) pathway. despite the fact that the hyperdirect pathway constitutes a central part of most of basal ganglia models, experimental studies concerning its synaptic transmission and plasticity are still lacking. this is mainly because in vitro brain slices do not preserve the hyperdirect pathway. here, we address this by developing a hyperdirect pathway brain slice where cortico-subthalamo-nigral connections were preserved. we characterized the transmission properties and its monosynaptic features between the frontal cortex and the stn, and between the stn and the substantia nigra pars reticulate (snr), the output nucleus of the hyperdirect pathway. cortical stimulation evoked monosynaptic glutamatergic events in stn neurons with a mean latency of 11.3 ms and a mean amplitude of 21 pa. stn stimulations evoked monosynaptic glutamatergic events in snr neurons with a mean latency of 2.5 ms and a mean amplitude of 116 pa. this brain slice also preserved a part of the direct and indirect pathways such as the cortico-striatal connection. this novel slice configuration containing the hyperdirect pathway is a useful tool to better understand the transmission and plasticity in this pathway and hence the physiology and the pathophysiology of basal ganglia.

742,"immortal particle for a catalytic branching process. we study the existence and asymptotic properties of a conservative branching particle system driven by a diffusion with smooth coefficients for which birth and death are triggered by contact with a set. sufficient conditions for the process to be non-explosive are given. in the brownian motions case the domain of evolution can be non-smooth, including lipschitz, with integrable martin kernel. the results are valid for an arbitrary number of particles and non-uniform redistribution after branching. additionally, with probability one, it is shown that only one ancestry line survives. in special cases, the evolution of the surviving particle is studied and for a two particle system on a half line we derive explicitly the transition function of a chain representing the position at successive branching times.

743,"characterization of 39 novel est-ssr markers for liriodendron tulipifera and cross-species amplification in l. chinense (magnoliaceae). premise of the study: a novel set of simple sequence repeat (ssr) markers were developed and characterized from the expressed sequence tag (est) database of liriodendron tulipifera for application in population genetic studies of liriodendron. 
 methods and results: thirty-nine polymorphic est-ssr loci were identified among 27 individuals sampled from a cultivated population of l. tulipifera. the number of alleles per locus ranged from three to 18. the average observed heterozygosity and expected heterozygosity were 0.684 and 0.778, respectively. of the 39 loci, 32 showed interspecific transferability and polymorphism in a related species, l. chinense. the number of alleles per locus ranged from two to 11, and the average observed heterozygosity and expected heterozygosity were 0.475 and 0.736, respectively. 
 conclusions: the developed est-ssr markers will be useful for investigating adaptive genetic differentiation in liriodendron.

745,"challenges in the transformation to lean production from different manufacturing-process choices: a path-dependent perspective. the implementation of lean production remains popular among industrial companies, and the requirement for individualised steps in its implementation is widely accepted; however, research has not yet considered the different process choices available to the companies. the conclusions drawn from the automotive industry's mass production environment may be misleading, given the different conditions of many other industries. we therefore compare case data from a craft producer with the rich, case-study based literature of mass producer companies that highlight the transformation from mass to lean production. we derive a list of specific challenges a craft producer must approach using a different strategy than a mass producer. this study adds to the lean production theory by demonstrating how different manufacturing process choices influence the lean transformation process and its successful implementation. it provides specific propositions concerning the transformation to lean by considering the different processes of craft and mass production companies. furthermore, the case study gives an in-depth understanding of the challenges a craft-oriented company faces when becoming lean.

746,"dissolved organic carbon release from surface sand of a high energy beach along the southeastern coast of north carolina, usa. the purpose of this study was to determine the flux of dissolved organic carbon (doc) from high-energy beach sand to the coastal ocean. the doc concentration of seawater was measured before and after exposure to the beach sand in laboratory experiments. increases were observed in all experiments (n=36) conducted on seawater and high-energy beach sand collected on a monthly basis for one year. final dissolved organic carbon in seawater after exposure to surface sands were positively correlated with water column doc concentrations measured in the surf zone at the same time of sand collection for laboratory experiments. increases in doc during laboratory experiments displayed marked seasonality with larger increases observed during summer with a corresponding low doc carbon to nitrogen ratio (c:n) suggesting phytoplankton as the source of doc during this time of year. higher doc c:n was observed during winter indicating a more aged organic material as the source of doc during this time of low flux. sandy beach sediments release over an order of magnitude more doc per meter squared compared to coastal shelf sediments and rainwater suggesting that in locations where there are no direct river inputs these beach environments play a significant, previously unrecognized role as an external source of doc to the immediate coastal ocean. it is likely that doc released from these environments has a significant effect on surf zone biogeochemistry potentially affecting oxygen concentrations in coastal regions.

747,"using a checklist to identify barriers to compliance with evidence-based guidelines for central line management: a mixed methods study in mongolia. objectives: this study aimed to determine the extent to which a checklist has potential for identifying barriers to compliance with central line management guidelines, to evaluate the potential utility of checklists to improve the management of central lines in mongolia, and to define the gap between current and best practices. 
 methods: a 22-item checklist was developed based on the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc, usa) guidelines and existing central line-associated bloodstream infection (clabsi) checklists. the checklist was used to observe 375 central line procedures performed in the intensive care units of four tertiary hospitals of mongolia between july and december 2010. in parallel, 36 face-to-face interviews were conducted in six other tertiary hospitals to explain practice variations and identify barriers. 
 results: the baseline compliance level across all components of the checklist was 68.5%. the main factors explaining low levels of compliance were outdated local standards, a lack of updated guidelines, poor control over compliance with existing clinical guidelines, poor supply of medical consumables, and insufficient knowledge of contemporary infection control measures among health care providers. 
 conclusions: the health authorities of mongolia need to adequately address the prevention and control of clabsis in their hospitals. updating local standards and guidelines and implementing adequate multifaceted interventions with behavioral, educational, and logistical components are required. use of a checklist as a baseline evaluation tool was feasible. it described current practice, showed areas that need urgent attention, and provided important information needed for future planning of clabsi interventions.

749,"localized brain activation related to the strength of auditory learning in a parrot. parrots and songbirds learn their vocalizations from a conspecific tutor, much like human infants acquire spoken language. parrots can learn human words and it has been suggested that they can use them to communicate with humans. the caudomedial pallium in the parrot brain is homologous with that of songbirds, and analogous to the human auditory association cortex, involved in speech processing. here we investigated neuronal activation, measured as expression of the protein product of the immediate early gene zenk, in relation to auditory learning in the budgerigar (melopsittacus undulatus), a parrot. budgerigar males successfully learned to discriminate two japanese words spoken by another male conspecific. re-exposure to the two discriminanda led to increased neuronal activation in the caudomedial pallium, but not in the hippocampus, compared to untrained birds that were exposed to the same words, or were not exposed to words. neuronal activation in the caudomedial pallium of the experimental birds was correlated significantly and positively with the percentage of correct responses in the discrimination task. these results suggest that in a parrot, the caudomedial pallium is involved in auditory learning. thus, in parrots, songbirds and humans, analogous brain regions may contain the neural substrate for auditory learning and memory.

753,"nanoparticles enhance therapeutic outcome in inflamed skin therapy. inflammatory reactions of the skin are a major therapeutic field; however, drug delivery is nowadays only related to the use of classical formulations like ointments and creams. here, we report the behaviour of polymeric submicron particles (np) for selective drug delivery to the inflamed skin. nps of nominal diameters from 50 to 1000 nm were administered to an experimental dithranol-induced dermatitis inflammation model in mice ears. the results revealed that smaller particles had an around 3-fold stronger and deeper penetration tendency with a preferential accumulation in inflamed skin hair follicles and sebaceous glands (2.8 +/- 0.6% and 2.3 +/- 0.4% for np100 and np50 compared to 0.84 +/- 0.04% and 0.92 +/- 0.02% for the same sizes on healthy skin). betamethasone loaded np confirmed the size dependency by being therapeutically more efficient from histological examination and measurement of different inflammatory markers in the skin (myeloperoxidase activity of untreated control, 1.2 +/- 0.4; np1000, 1.0 +/- 0.4; np100, 0.5 +/- 0.2, all u/mg). this approach holds a high potential for a selective therapy to the inflamed skin by increasing the local intradermal availability with simultaneous reduction in systemic adverse effects.

757,"adhesion of human pathogenic enteric viruses and surrogate viruses to inert and vegetal food surfaces. enteric viruses, particularly human noroviruses (nov) and hepatitis a virus (hav), are key food-borne pathogens. the attachment of these pathogens to foodstuff and food-contact surfaces is an important mechanism in the human contamination process. studies were done to investigate the nature of the physicochemical forces, such as hydrophobic and electrostatic ones, involved in the interaction virus/matrix but, at this day, only few data are available concerning surface properties of viruses and prediction of the adhesion capacity of one specific virus onto matrices is still very difficult. 
 the purpose of this study was to propose a reference system, including a representative virus surrogate, able to predict as close as possible behaviour of pathogenic viruses in term of adhesion on inert (stainless steel and polypropylene) and food surfaces (lettuce leaves, strawberries and raspberries). the adhesion of human pathogenic enteric viruses, cultivable strain of hav and non-cultivable strains of human nov (genogroups i and ii), have been quantified and compared to these of human enteric viruses surrogates, included the mnv-1 and three f-specific rna bacteriophages (ms2, ga and q beta). a standardized approach was developed to assess and quantify viral adhesion on tested matrices after a contact time with each virus using real-time rt-pcr. methods used for virus recovery were in accordance with the cen recommendations, including a bovine enterovirus type 1 as control to monitor the efficiency of the extraction process and amplification procedure from directly extracted or eluted samples. the adhesion of human pathogenic viruses, ranging from 0.1 to 2%, could be comparable for all matrices studied, except for nov gii on soft fruits. adhesion percentages obtained for the studied surrogate virus and phages were shown to be comparable to those of hav and nov on inert and lettuce surfaces. the mnv-1 appeared as the best candidate to simulate adhesion phenomena of all human pathogenic enteric viruses on all studied surfaces, while ms2 and ga bacteriophages could be a good alternative as model of viral adhesion on inert and lettuce surfaces. these results will be usable to design relevant experimental systems integrating adhesion behaviour of enteric viruses in the assessment of the efficiency of a technological or hygienic industrial process.

758,"trunk muscle control in response to (un)expected turns in cart pushing. before altering the travel direction in normal gait, anticipatory activation in trunk muscles is observed, followed by a top-down sequence of rotation of body segments. turning while pushing a cart is a more challenging task for the trunk because of its low stiffness in pushing while walking and the interaction with the high inertia of the cart. 12 healthy subjects pushed a 200 kg cart at shoulder and hip height while making turns (gradual, sharp and unexpected sharp). the normalized electromyogram amplitudes of left (right) lateral and anterior external oblique muscle, and right (left) internal oblique muscle were averaged to represent left (right) trunk rotator muscle activity. the baseline values of trunk rotator muscle activity before the turn and the peak values after the turn were determined. additionally, peak values of hand forces, twisting moments and twisting motions were assessed. before turning, higher trunk rotator muscle activity than in straight pushing without turning was only observed before making a turn in the gradual or sharp turn conditions. after the turn, clockwise twisting motion was associated with a clockwise twisting moment induced by the reaction forces at the left hand. anticipatory activation was initially absent in the unexpected sharp turn, while bilateral trunk rotator muscle activity increased after the turn, indicating co-contraction. in the unexpected turn condition the combination of an uncontrolled twisting motion with delayed muscle activation may increase the potential risk of low-back injury.

760,"avoiding pitfalls of internal controls: validation of reference genes for analysis by qrt-pcr and western blot throughout rat retinal development. background: housekeeping genes have been commonly used as reference to normalize gene expression and protein content data because of its presumed constitutive expression. in this paper, we challenge the consensual idea that housekeeping genes are reliable controls for expression studies in the retina through the investigation of a panel of reference genes potentially suitable for analysis of different stages of retinal development. 
 methodology/principal findings: we applied statistical tools on combinations of retinal developmental stages to assess the most stable internal controls for quantitative rt-pcr (qrt-pcr). the stability of expression of seven putative reference genes (actb, b2m, gapdh, hprt1, mapk1, ppia and rn18s) was analyzed using genorm, bestkeeper and normfinder software. in addition, several housekeeping genes were tested as loading controls for western blot in the same sample panel, using image j. overall, for qrt-pcr the combination of gapdh and mapk1 showed the highest stability for most experimental sets. actb was downregulated in more mature stages, while rn18s and hprt1 showed the highest variability. we normalized the expression of cyclin d1 using various reference genes and demonstrated that spurious results may result from blind selection of internal controls. for western blot significant variation could be seen among four putative internal controls (bactin, cyclophilin b, alpha-tubulin and lamin a/c), while mapk1 was stably expressed. 
 conclusion: putative housekeeping genes exhibit significant variation in both mrna and protein content during retinal development. our results showed that distinct combinations of internal controls fit for each experimental set in the case of qrt-pcr and that mapk1 is a reliable loading control for western blot. the results indicate that biased study outcomes may follow the use of reference genes without prior validation for qrt-pcr and western blot.

766,"mock data challenge for the einstein gravitational-wave telescope. the einstein telescope (et) is conceived to be a third generation gravitational-wave (gw) observatory. its amplitude sensitivity would be a factor 10 better than advanced ligo and virgo and it could also extend the low-frequency sensitivity down to 1-3 hz, compared to the 10-20 hz of advanced detectors. such an observatory will have the potential to observe a variety of different gw sources, including compact binary systems at cosmological distances. et's expected reach for binary neutron star (bns) coalescences is out to redshift z similar or equal to 2 and the rate of detectable bns coalescences could be as high as one every few tens or hundreds of seconds, each lasting up to several days. with such a signal-rich environment, a key question in data analysis is whether overlapping signals can be discriminated. in this paper we simulate the gw signals from a cosmological population of bns and ask the following questions: does this population create a confusion background that limits et's ability to detect foreground sources? how efficient are current algorithms in discriminating overlapping bns signals? is it possible to discern the presence of a population of signals in the data by cross correlating data from different detectors in the et observatory? we find that algorithms currently used to analyze ligo and virgo data are already powerful enough to detect the sources expected in et, but new algorithms are required to fully exploit et data.

771,"a personalized medicine approach to biologic treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: a preliminary treatment algorithm. ra is a syndrome consisting of different pathogenetic subsets in which distinct molecular mechanisms may drive common final pathways. recent work has provided proof of principle that biomarkers may be identified predictive of the response to targeted therapy. based on new insights, an initial treatment algorithm is presented that may be used to guide treatment decisions in patients who have failed one tnf inhibitor. key questions in this algorithm relate to the question whether the patient is a primary vs a secondary non-responder to tnf blockade and whether the patient is rf and/or anti-citrullinated peptide antibody positive. this preliminary algorithm may contribute to more cost-effective treatment of ra, and provides the basis for more extensive algorithms when additional data become available.

772,"non-relativistic lee model in two-dimensional riemannian manifolds. this work is a continuation of our previous work [f. erman and o. t. turgut, j. math. phys. 48, 122103 ( 2007)], where we constructed the non-relativistic lee model in three-dimensional riemannian manifolds. here we renormalize the two-dimensional version by using the same methods and the results are shortly given since the calculations are basically the same as in the three-dimensional model. we also show that the ground state energy is bounded from below due to the upper bound of the heat kernel for compact and cartan-hadamard manifolds. in contrast to the construction of the model and the proof of the lower bound of the ground state energy, the mean field approximation to the two-dimensional model is not similar to the one in three dimensions and it requires a deeper analysis, which is the main result of this paper.

774,"lung ultrasound in the icu: from diagnostic instrument to respiratory monitoring tool. imaging has greatly contributed to the understanding of lung disease in the critically ill and currently serves as a tool to diagnose lung pathology, monitor its course, and guide clinical management. lung ultrasound is a real-time imaging modality that is simple, non-invasive, potentially ubiquitous, and free of ionizing radiation. its increasing popularity and supporting research data substantiate its role as an emerging technique for bedside chest imaging in critical care. furthermore, the international consensus conference on lung ultrasound (icc-lus) promoted by the world interactive network focused on critical ultrasound (winfocus) recently standardized the nomenclature and technique for lung ultrasound, and provided recommendations supporting its use in clinical practice. while the utility of lung ultrasound in the emergency setting is unquestioned, its potential role in the more complex and resource-rich intensive care environment is still under investigation. the purpose of this paper was to describe current and potential uses of lung ultrasound in the specific setting of adult intensive care, with an emphasis on respiratory monitoring, and to provide a framework for the practical application of this tool at the bedside.

775,"a large-scale empirical study of conficker. conficker is the most recent widespread, well-known worm/bot. according to several reports, it has infected about 7 million to 15 million hosts and the victims are still increasing even now. in this paper, we analyze conficker infections at a large scale, about 25 million victims, and study various interesting aspects about this state-of-the-art malware. by analyzing conficker, we intend to understand current and new trends in malware propagation, which could be very helpful in predicting future malware trends and providing insights for future malware defense. we observe that conficker has some very different victim distribution patterns compared to many previous generation worms/botnets, suggesting that new malware spreading models and defense strategies are likely needed. we measure the potential power of conficker to estimate its effects on the networks/hosts when it performs malicious operations. furthermore, we intend to determine how well a reputation-based blacklisting approach can perform when faced with new malware threats such as conficker. we cross-check several dns blacklists and ip/as reputation data from dshield and fire and our evaluation shows that unlike a previous study which shows that a blacklist-based approach can detect most bots, these reputation-based approaches did relatively poorly for conficker. this raises a question of how we can improve and complement existing reputation-based techniques to prepare for future malware defense? based on this, we look into some insights for defenders. we show that neighborhood watch is a surprisingly effective approach in the case of conficker. this suggests that security alert sharing/correlation (particularly among neighborhood networks) could be a promising approach and play a more important role for future malware defense.

779,"cyclic amp-induced conformational changes in mycobacterial protein acetyltransferases. the activities of a number of proteins are regulated by the binding of camp and cgmp to cyclic nucleotide binding (cnb) domains that are found associated with one or more effector domains with diverse functions. although the conserved architecture of cnb domains has been extensively studied by x-ray crystallography, the key to unraveling the mechanisms of camp action has been protein dynamics analyses. recently, we have identified a novel camp-binding protein from mycobacteria, where camp regulates the activity of an associated protein acetyltransferase domain. in the current study, we have monitored the conformational changes that occur upon camp binding to the cnb domain in these proteins, using a combination of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer and amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. coupled with mutational analyses, our studies reveal the critical role of the linker region (positioned between the cnb domain and the acetyltransferase domain) in allosteric coupling of camp binding to activation of acetyltransferase catalysis. importantly, major differences in conformational change upon camp binding were accompanied by stabilization of the cnb and linker domain alone. this is in contrast to other camp-binding proteins, where cyclic nucleotide binding has been shown to involve intricate and parallel allosteric relays. finally, this powerful convergence of results from bioluminescence resonance energy transfer and hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry reaffirms the power of solution biophysical tools in unraveling mechanistic bases of regulation of proteins in the absence of high resolution structural information.

780,"ddor: destination discovery oriented routing in highway/freeway vanets(+). the emerging adoption of wireless communications on surface transportation systems has generated extensive interest among researchers over the last several years. innovative inter-vehicular communications and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications achieve road traffic safety, ecstatic driving and delightful travelling experiences. multi-hop information dissemination in vehicular ad hoc networks is challenged by high mobility and frequent disconnections of wireless nodes. this paper presents a new routing scheme for highway/freeway vanets, which consists of a unicast destination discovery process, a robust forward node selection mechanism and a positional hello mechanism. in this paper, no dedicated path is framed in order to prevent frequent path maintenance. in addition, the avoidance of flooding and location services substantially reduces the control overhead. positional hello scheme ensures connectivity and diminishes control overhead concurrently. simulation results signify the benefits of the proposed routing strategy (i.e. ddor) has higher packet delivery ratio, reduced routing overhead and shorter delay compared with previous works.

782,"robustness analysis and tuning of generalized predictive control using frequency domain approaches. the paper presents a new frequency-domain methodology to explicitly address the robustness margins for analysis and tuning of generalized predictive control (gpc). the gpc is formulated in two-degree-of-freedom configuration to allow for simultaneous execution of robustness analysis and frequency characteristic shaping. the underlying idea is to present a robust tuning scheme for gpc scheme by synthesizing some sensitivity functions in discrete-time domain, quantifying the relevant cause-and-effect perturbations, in order to shape them so that the effects of influences can be reduced in a specific frequency range. several frequency-domain templates have been introduced to practically demonstrate usefulness of output, noise, and input sensitivity functions as complementing analysis tools for robust tuning of gpc. the proposed method ensures robust adjustments of the non-trivial tuning of gpc free parameter knobs through simultaneous realization of robustness analysis and frequency characteristic shaping. the method can hence be utilized as a powerful method for tuning of gpc for a wide range of single-input single-output (siso) linear systems. illustrative simulation examples have been conducted to explore the effectiveness of the proposed method.

783,"inhibition of sumoylation prevents experimental fibrosis. objectives fibrosis is a predominant cause of death in systemic sclerosis (ssc). first epigenetic modifications have recently been shown to contribute to activation of ssc fibroblasts. here, we investigated inhibition of sumoylation as a novel antifibrotic approach. 
 methods sumoylation was inhibited by sirna-mediated knockdown of the small ubiquitin-like modifiers (sumo) e2-conjugating enzyme ubc9, which is essential for sumoylation. the effects of knockdown of ubc9 were analysed in bleomycin-induced dermal fibrosis, and in the model of fibrosis induced by overexpression of a constitutively active tgf-beta receptor type i (tbr). sumo-1 and phosphorylated smad3 were detected by immunohistochemistry. 
 results increased staining for sumo-1 was detected in patients with ssc and in experimental fibrosis. inhibition of sumoylation exerted potent antifibrotic effects and prevented dermal thickening, myofibroblast differentiation and accumulation of collagen induced by bleomycin, or by overexpression of constitutively active tbr. moreover, knockdown of ubc9 reduced the accumulation of phosphorylated smad3 in experimental fibrosis indicating that inhibition of sumoylation may normalise canonical tgf-beta signalling in vivo. 
 conclusions we demonstrate that inhibition of sumoylation reduces canonical tgf-beta signalling and prevents experimental fibrosis in different preclinical models. these data provide first evidence that targeting of aberrant sumoylation may be a novel therapeutic approach for fibrotic diseases.

785,"tailored profiles made of tailor rolled strips by roll forming - part 1 of 2. to fully exploit the potential of sheet and profiles, various technologies to produce tailored blanks and profiles have been developed [1,2]. in earlier work [3] it has been shown that strip profile rolling (spr) can be used to produce metal strips with a predefined thickness distribution across the width of the strip. building upon this knowledge, in two subsequent papers the extended goal of the project is presented. therein is demonstrated that strip profile rolling can be applied very effectively using a combination of roll forming (part 1) as well as further processing by roll forming (see part 2) to allow for the production of profiles with varying wall thickness in their cross section. to achieve the goal of part 1, a numerical model describing spr was developed and used to study the influencing process parameters on spread and bulge formation. as a result of this parametric study, an optimized roll design and rolling sequence was developed to produce a demonstrator strip on a 12 stand roll forming mill manufactured by the company dreistern [4]. starting with a conventional strip out of dc01 steel (width 170?mm, thickness 2.5?mm), 29 rolling passes were necessary to achieve the desired geometry (width 186?mm, thickness 2.5?mm with a longitudinal groove being 64?mm wide where the thickness is reduced to 1.5?mm). in the second part of the process chain the coils produced by strip profile rolling were successfully roll formed into a circular tube of 60?mm.

795,"a generalized sampling theorem for stable reconstructions in arbitrary bases. we introduce a generalized framework for sampling and reconstruction in separable hilbert spaces. specifically, we establish that it is always possible to stably reconstruct a vector in an arbitrary riesz basis from sufficiently many of its samples in any other riesz basis. this framework can be viewed as an extension of the well-known consistent reconstruction technique (eldar et al.). however, whilst the latter imposes stringent assumptions on the reconstruction basis, and may in practice be unstable, our framework allows for recovery in any (riesz) basis in a manner that is completely stable. 
 whilst the classical shannon sampling theorem is a special case of our theorem, this framework allows us to exploit additional information about the approximated vector (or, in this case, function), for example sparsity or regularity, to design a reconstruction basis that is better suited. examples are presented illustrating this procedure.

802,"s1p and the birth of platelets. recent work has highlighted the multitude of biological functions of sphingosine 1-phosphate (s1p), which include roles in hematopoietic cell trafficking, organization of immune organs, vascular development, and neuroinflammation. indeed, a functional antagonist of s1p(1) receptor, fty720/gilenya, has entered the clinic as a novel therapeutic for multiple sclerosis. in this issue of the jem, zhang et al. highlight yet another function of this lipid mediator: thrombopoiesis. the s1p(1) receptor is required for the growth of proplatelet strings in the bloodstream and the shedding of platelets into the circulation. notably, the sharp gradient of s1p between blood and the interstitial fluids seems to be essential to ensure the production of platelets, and s1p appears to cooperate with the cxcl12-cxcr4 axis. pharmacologic modulation of the s1p(1) receptor altered circulating platelet numbers acutely, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for controlling thrombocytopenic states. however, the s1p(4) receptor may also regulate thrombopoiesis during stress-induced accelerated platelet production. this work reveals a novel physiological action of the s1p/s1p(1) duet that could potentially be harnessed for clinical translation.

804,"evidence for the two-state-two-mode model in retinal protonated schiff-bases from pump degenerate four-wave-mixing experiments. we apply spectrally-resolved pump degenerate four-wave-mixing for the characterization of excited state low-frequency vibrational coherences during the initial events in excited state double-bond isomerization of retinal protonated schiff-bases. a set of low-frequency coherences in the energetic range of 100-350 cm(-1) appears in the dynamics already for very early delays after initial excitation (&lt;100 fs). the modulations are rapidly damped (&lt;800 fs) and detectable only in a certain time window after initial excitation (&lt;0.6 ps). following the initial relaxation process, which leads the molecule to a stationary point in the s-1 state, it is not possible to re-excite the coherences in the excited state. based on our observations, we conclude that the activation of the coherences is only possible to occur in a well-defined region of the excited state potential near the franck-condon region. our results give direct experimental indication for the validity of the two-state-two-mode model, frequently applied for the interpretation of retinal isomerization dynamics.

805,"isolation and characterization of tumor cells from the ascites of ovarian cancer patients: molecular phenotype of chemoresistant ovarian tumors. tumor cells in ascites are a major source of disease recurrence in ovarian cancer patients. in an attempt to identify and profile the population of ascites cells obtained from ovarian cancer patients, a novel method was developed to separate adherent (ad) and non-adherent (nad) cells in culture. twenty-five patients were recruited to this study; 11 chemonaive (cn) and 14 chemoresistant (cr). ad cells from both cn and cr patients exhibited mesenchymal morphology with an antigen profile of mesenchymal stem cells and fibroblasts. conversely, nad cells had an epithelial morphology with enhanced expression of cancer antigen 125 (ca125), epithelial cell adhesion molecule (epcam) and cytokeratin 7. nad cells developed infiltrating tumors and ascites within 12-14 weeks after intraperitoneal (i.p.)injections into nude mice, whereas ad cells remained non-tumorigenic for up to 20 weeks. subsequent comparison of selective epithelial, mesenchymal and cancer stem cell (csc) markers between ad and nad populations of cn and cr patients demonstrated an enhanced trend in mrna expression of e-cadherin, epcam, stat3 and oct4 in the nad population of cr patients. a similar trend of enhanced mrna expression of cd44, mmp9 and oct4 was observed in the ad population of cr patients. hence, using a novel purification method we demonstrate for the first time a distinct separation of ascites cells into epithelial tumorigenic and mesenchymal non-tumorigenic populations. we also demonstrate that cells from the ascites of cr patients are predominantly epithelial and show a trend towards increased mrna expression of genes associated with cscs, compared to cells isolated from the ascites of cn patients. as the tumor cells in the ascites of ovarian cancer patients play a dominant role in disease recurrence, a thorough understanding of the biology of the ascites microenvironment from cr and cn patients is essential for effective therapeutic interventions.

808,"microbial diversity in deep-sea methane seep sediments presented by ssu rrna gene tag sequencing. microbial community structures in methane seep sediments in the nankai trough were analyzed by tag-sequencing analysis for the small subunit (ssu) rrna gene using a newly developed primer set. the dominant members of archaea were deep-sea hydrothermal vent euryarchaeotic group 6 (dhveg 6), marine group i (mgi) and deep sea archaeal group (dsag), and those in bacteria were alpha-, gamma-, delta- and epsilonproteobacteria, chloroflexi, bacteroidetes, planctomycetes and acidobacteria. diversity and richness were examined by 8,709 and 7,690 tag-sequences from sediments at 5 and 25 cm below the seafloor (cmbsf), respectively. the estimated diversity and richness in the methane seep sediment are as high as those in soil and deep-sea hydrothermal environments, although the tag-sequences obtained in this study were not sufficient to show whole microbial diversity in this analysis. we also compared the diversity and richness of each taxon/division between the sediments from the two depths, and found that the diversity and richness of some taxa/divisions varied significantly along with the depth.

810,"amplification and high-level expression of heat shock protein 90 marks aggressive phenotypes of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative breast cancer. introduction: although human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2) positive or estrogen receptor (er) positive breast cancers are treated with clinically validated anti-her2 or anti-estrogen therapies, intrinsic and acquired resistance to these therapies appears in a substantial proportion of breast cancer patients and new therapies are needed. identification of additional molecular factors, especially those characterized by aggressive behavior and poor prognosis, could prioritize interventional opportunities to improve the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. 
 methods: we compiled a collection of 4,010 breast tumor gene expression data derived from 23 datasets that have been posted on the national center for biotechnology information (ncbi) gene expression omnibus (geo) database. we performed a genome-scale survival analysis using cox-regression survival analyses, and validated using kaplan-meier estimates survival and cox proportional-hazards regression survival analyses. we conducted a genome-scale analysis of chromosome alteration using 481 breast cancer samples obtained from the cancer genome atlas (tcga), from which combined expression and copy number data were available. we assessed the correlation between somatic copy number alterations and gene expression using analysis of variance (anova). 
 results: increased expression of each of the heat shock protein (hsp) 90 isoforms, as well as hsp transcriptional factor 1 (hsf1), was correlated with poor prognosis in different subtypes of breast cancer. high-level expression of hsp90aa1 and hsp90ab1, two cytoplasmic hsp90 isoforms, was driven by chromosome coding region amplifications and were independent factors that led to death from breast cancer among patients with triple-negative (tnbc) and her2-/er+ subtypes, respectively. furthermore, amplification of hsf1 was correlated with higher hsp90aa1 and hsp90ab1 mrna expression among the breast cancer cells without amplifications of these two genes. a collection of hsp90aa1, hsp90ab1 and hsf1 amplifications defined a subpopulation of breast cancer with up-regulated hsp90 gene expression, and up-regulated hsp90 expression independently elevated the risk of recurrence of tnbc and poor prognosis of her2-/er+ breast cancer. 
 conclusions: up-regulated hsp90 mrna expression represents a confluence of genomic vulnerability that renders her2 negative breast cancers more aggressive, resulting in poor prognosis. targeting breast cancer with upregulated hsp90 may potentially improve the effectiveness of clinical intervention in this disease.

811,"hmgb1-rage regulates muscle satellite cell homeostasis through p38-mapk- and myogenin-dependent repression of pax7 transcription. expression of the paired-box 7 (pax7) transcription factor is regulated during both myoblast proliferation and differentiation: high levels of pax7 compromise myogenic differentiation because of excess and prolonged proliferation, whereas low levels of pax7 result in precocious differentiation. we showed that myogenin repressed pax7 transcription in differentiating myoblasts by binding to specific recognition sites in the pax7 promoter, and that high-mobility group box 1 (hmgb1)-receptor for advanced glycation end-products (rage) signaling was required for myogenin induction and myogenin-dependent repression of pax7 transcription. in addition, pax7 negatively and myogenin positively regulated rage expression. rage, a multiligand receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily, was not expressed in adult skeletal muscles, and was transiently expressed in activated, proliferating and differentiating satellite cells (scs) in injured muscles. compared with wild-type muscles, rage(-/-) muscles exhibited increased numbers of basal scs that were further increased in injured rage(-/-) muscles following elevated myoblast asymmetric division; complete regeneration of injured rage(-/-) muscles was found to be delayed by similar to 1 week. thus, rage signaling physiologically repressed pax7 transcription in scs by upregulating myogenin, thereby accelerating muscle regeneration and limiting sc self-renewal.

812,"regulation of interferon-beta by magi-1 and its interaction with influenza a virus ns1 protein with esev pbm. the ns1 protein from avian influenza a viruses contains a pdz binding motif (pbm) at its carboxyl terminus with the consensus sequence esev. the esev pbm confers binding to several cellular pdz proteins, including dlg1, magi-1 and scribble. the interaction between ns1 and scribble protects infected cells from apoptosis, while the interaction between ns1 and both dlg1 and scribble disrupts tight junctions. in this study, we examined the magi-1 protein. we made the unexpected observation that sirna depletion of magi-1 activates irf3 and induces the ifn-beta promoter. we found that the esev ns1 protein sequesters magi-1 away from the plasma membrane in infected cells. using plasmid vectors to express ns1 proteins, we observed that the esev pbm elicits an ifn-beta induction signal as indicated by activation of irf3 and a relative deficiency in ns1 inhibition of induction of the ifn-beta promoter by dsrna or rig-i. taken together, our data suggest that disruption of magi-1 by the esev pbm activates an ifn-beta induction signal. during viral infection, however, induction of the ifn-beta gene does not occur presumably because other anti-ifn functions dominate over the ifn-activation activity of the esev pbm. we postulate that the esev pbm's broad binding activity for pdz proteins may allow ns1 to bind to some pdz proteins such as magi-1 that confer no benefit or may even be detrimental to viral replication. however, the advantage of binding to key pdz proteins such as dlg1 and scribble may dominate and therefore provide an overall benefit for the virus to encode the esev pbm.

813,"functional development of a transplanted embryonic kidney: effect of transplantation site. background: a xenotransplanted metanephros may undergo complete nephrogenesis in the host animal, forming a functional kidney. this suggests that, in future, xenometanephroi could become an unlimited source of material for renal transplantation. although the omentum (om) is the primary site for transplantation, we speculated that the growth of the transplant could differ depending on the site of transplantation. thus, we determined the optimal transplantation site for the metanephros in terms of retaining its ability to produce renin and erythropoietin (epo). 
 methods: rat metanephroi were transplanted into the om, paraaortic area (pa), or both (om+pa) of unilaterally nephrectomized host rats. after 2-3 weeks, blood was rapidly withdrawn in order to induce production of renin and epo in the transplants. 
 results: histological analysis indicated that transplants in both the pa and om were well differentiated, demonstrating polarity of the medulla through to the cortex. plasma renin activity (pra) increased in response to the induction procedure, but transplants in the pa expressed pra more effectively than did those in the om. real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) revealed higher levels of renin mrna expression in transplants in the pa than in those in the om. although epo production increased 24 hours after the induction procedure, the levels did not differ significantly between om-and pa-transplanted rats. 
 conclusion: compared with transplantation to the om, transplantation of rat metanephroi to the pa results in better renin production, whereas the transplantation site does not affect epo production.

814,"polycyclic quinolones (part 1) - thieno[2,3-b]benzo[h]quinoline derivatives: design, synthesis, preliminary in vitro and in silico studies. heterocyclic systems with a quinoline nucleus represent the most spectacular example of privileged molecules in medicinal chemistry, as their biological activities are surely affected by changes in structural features. quin line derivatives have been shown to display a wide spectrum of biological activities such as antibacterial, antifungal, antiparasitic, antiviral, cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory activities. in this study, several 7-hydroxy-8-oxo-8,9-dihydrobenzo[h]thieno[2,3-b]quinoline-9-carboxylic acids were designed, synthesized, and were further subjected to chemical reactions such as alkylation and annelation. the synthesized compounds were also subjected to docking study and biological evaluation. this work was mainly designed to shed light on the requirements for the quinoline nucleus to act as an anticancer agent. unexpectedly, the synthesized derivatives showed weak or no cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines and the increase in the extent of aromatic/condensed rings did not increase the affinity toward the double stranded dna. our virtual screening demonstrated that the chelation with mg2+ is a determining factor in the expected interaction with topoisomerases. key synthetic issues, crystallographic and docking studies have also been described.

815,"untranslated regions of diverse plant viral rnas vary greatly in translation enhancement efficiency. background: whole plants or plant cell cultures can serve as low cost bioreactors to produce massive amounts of a specific protein for pharmacological or industrial use. to maximize protein expression, translation of mrna must be optimized. many plant viral rnas harbor extremely efficient translation enhancers. however, few of these different translation elements have been compared side-by-side. thus, it is unclear which are the most efficient translation enhancers. here, we compare the effects of untranslated regions (utrs) containing translation elements from six plant viruses on translation in wheat germ extract and in monocotyledenous and dicotyledenous plant cells. 
 results: the highest expressing uncapped mrnas contained viral utrs harboring barley yellow dwarf virus (bydv)-like cap-independent translation elements (btes). the bydv bte conferred the most efficient translation of a luciferase reporter in wheat germ extract and oat protoplasts, while uncapped mrna containing the bte from tobacco necrosis virus-d translated most efficiently in tobacco cells. capped mrna containing the tobacco mosaic virus omega sequence was the most efficient mrna in tobacco cells. utrs from satellite tobacco necrosis virus, tomato bushy stunt virus, and crucifer-infecting tobamovirus (crtmv) did not stimulate translation efficiently. mrna with the crtmv 5' utr was unstable in tobacco protoplasts. 
 conclusions: btes confer the highest levels of translation of uncapped mrnas in vitro and in vivo, while the capped omega sequence is most efficient in tobacco cells. these results provide a basis for understanding mechanisms of translation enhancement, and for maximizing protein synthesis in cell-free systems, transgenic plants, or in viral expression vectors.

817,"the benefits of yoga for women veterans with chronic low back pain. objectives: chronic low back (clbp) pain is prevalent among military veterans and often leads to functional limitations, psychologic symptoms, lower quality of life, and higher health care costs. an increasing proportion of u.s. veterans are women, and women veterans may have different health care needs than men veterans. the purpose of this study was to assess the impact of a yoga intervention on women and men with clbp. 
 subjects/setting/intervention: va patients with clbp were referred by primary care providers to a clinical yoga program. design: research participants completed a brief battery of questionnaires before their first yoga class and again 10 weeks later in a single-group, pre-post study design. 
 outcome measures: questionnaires included measures of pain (pain severity scale), depression (cesd-10), energy/fatigue, and health-related quality of life (sf-12). yoga attendance and home practice of yoga were also measured. repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to analyze group differences over time while controlling for baseline differences. 
 results: the 53 participants who completed both assessments had a mean age of 53 years, and were well educated, 41% nonwhite, 49% married, and had varying employment status. women participants had significantly larger decreases in depression (p = 0.046) and pain on average (p = 0.050), and larger increases in energy (p = 0.034) and sf-12 mental health (p = 0.044) than men who participated. the groups did not differ significantly on yoga attendance or home practice of yoga. 
 conclusions: these results suggest that women veterans may benefit more than men veterans from yoga interventions for chronic back pain. conclusions are tentative because of the small sample size and quasi-experimental study design. a more rigorous study is being designed to answer these research questions more definitively.

820,"phylogeography and conservation genetics of the amazonian freshwater stingray paratrygon aiereba muller &amp; henle, 1841 (chondrichthyes: potamotrygonidae). the family potamotrygonidae is monophyletic comprising three genera: paratrygon dumeril, potamotrygon garman and plesiotrygon rosa, castello &amp; thorson. the distribution of most species in this family is restricted to a single basin or fluvial system. only potamotrygon motor, potamotrygon orbignyi and paratrygon aiereba are found in more than one river basin. in this study we investigate genetic structuring of paratrygon aiereba, from five rivers of the amazon region: negro, solimoes-amazon-estuary system, tapajos, xingu and araguaia. sixty-three individuals were sequenced for atpase 6, and a representative subsample of 27 individuals was sequenced for coi. the coi dataset analysis indicated that paratrygon is sister to all other potamotrygonid genera and species. population parameters inferred from the analysis of atpase 6 sequences revealed that the populations of this species are structured within each river, with no or nearly non-existent gene flow occurring between rivers and a positive correlation between geographic and genetic distances. paratrygon aiereba is comprised of three geographically restricted clades with k2p interclade distances of at least 2%. intraspecific divergence within p aiereba is similar to the interspecific divergence observed in potamotrygon spp. sampled throughout the same geographic area. using the premises of coi barcoding and the allopatric distribution of the three p aiereba clades, the taxon p aiereba most likely comprises three distinct biological species. since freshwater stingrays of the family potamotrygonidae are highly exploited for the aquarium trade, management and conservation strategies need to be implemented at the level of each river basin, rather than at the level of the amazon basin.

823,"tnf-alpha up-regulates protein level and cell surface expression of the leptin receptor by stimulating its export via a pkc-dependent mechanism. increasing evidence suggests that inflammation/cytokines may modulate hypothalamic responses to leptin, which is a key regulator of energy homeostasis and inflammatory/stress responses. we investigated a possible role of tnf-alpha, a key early mediator of inflammation, in regulating the expression and trafficking of the long-isoform leptin receptor (leprb), the primary mediator of leptin signaling, in cultured cells. we found that tnf-alpha in a wide range of concentrations up-regulated leprb protein level and soluble lepr (slepr) release via ectodomain shedding of leprb in multiple cell types, including neuronal cells. tnf-alpha also acutely increased leprb cell surface expression and leptin-induced stat3 phosphorylation. in contrast, tnf-alpha had no significant effects on the protein level or cell surface expression of several other transmembrane proteins, including the transferrin receptor and cadherin. the stimulatory effects of tnf-alpha on leprb cell surface expression and slepr release were not dependent on de novo protein synthesis or functional lysosomes but were blocked by brefeldin a, suggesting that an intact golgi or continuous endoplasmic reticulum to golgi transport of newly synthesized proteins is required for these effects. however, tnf-alpha did not increase the half-life of cell surface leprb. protein kinase c (pkc) inhibitor gf109203x abrogated the effects of tnf-alpha, whereas the pan-pkc activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate mimicked the tnf-alpha effects. taken together, our results suggest that tnf-alpha, via activation of pkc, regulates anterograde trafficking and/or degradation of leprb in the biosynthetic pathway, leading to concomitant increases in leprb protein level, cell surface expression, and slepr production. the finding that leprb cell surface expression and slepr production, key modulators of leptin sensitivity and bioavailability, are direct targets of tnf-alpha signaling could have a potentially important implication in the regulation of leptin signaling activity in different pathophysiological conditions as diverse as obesity and sepsis.

826,"genotypic and phenotypic traits that distinguish neonatal meningitis-associated escherichia coli from fecal e. coli isolates of healthy human hosts. neonatal meningitis escherichia coli (nmec) is one of the top causes of neonatal meningitis worldwide. here, 85 nmec and 204 fecal e. coli isolates from healthy humans (hfec) were compared for possession of traits related to virulence, antimicrobial resistance, and plasmid content. this comparison was done to identify traits that typify nmec and distinguish it from commensal strains to refine the definition of the nmec subpathotype, identify traits that might contribute to nmec pathogenesis, and facilitate choices of nmec strains for future study. a large number of e. coli strains from both groups were untypeable, with the most common serogroups occurring among nmec being o18, followed by o83, o7, o12, and o1. nmec strains were more likely than hfec strains to be assigned to the b2 phylogenetic group. few nmec or hfec strains were resistant to antimicrobials. genes that best discriminated between nmec and hfec strains and that were present in more than 50% of nmec isolates were mainly from extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli genomic and plasmid pathogenicity islands. several of these defining traits had not previously been associated with nmec pathogenesis, are of unknown function, and are plasmid located. several genes that had been previously associated with nmec virulence did not dominate among the nmec isolates. these data suggest that there is much about nmec virulence that is unknown and that there are pitfalls to studying single nmec isolates to represent the entire subpathotype.

827,"soluble amyloid precursor protein 770 is released from inflamed endothelial cells and activated platelets a novel biomarker for acute coronary syndrome. most alzheimer disease (ad) patients show deposition of amyloid beta (a beta) peptide in blood vessels as well as the brain parenchyma. we previously found that vascular endothelial cells express amyloid beta precursor protein (app) 770, a different app isoform from neuronal app695, and produce a beta. since the soluble app cleavage product, sapp, is considered to be a possible marker for ad diagnosis, sapp has been widely measured as a mixture of these variants. we hypothesized that measurement of the endothelial app770 cleavage product in patients separately from that of neuronal app695 would enable discrimination between endothelial and neurological dysfunctions. using our newly developed elisa system for sapp770, we observed that inflammatory cytokines significantly enhanced sapp770 secretion by endothelial cells. furthermore, we unexpectedly found that sapp770 was rapidly released from activated platelets. we also found that cerebrospinal fluid mainly contained sapp695, while serum mostly contained sapp770. finally, to test our hypothesis that sapp770 could be an indicator for endothelial dysfunction, we applied our app770 elisa to patients with acute coronary syndrome (acs), in which endothelial injury and platelet activation lead to fibrous plaque disruption and thrombus formation. development of a biomarker is essential to facilitate acs diagnosis in clinical practice. the results revealed that acs patients had significantly higher plasma sapp770 levels. furthermore, in myocardial infarction model rats, an increase in plasma sapp preceded the release of cardiac enzymes, currently used markers for acute myocardial infarction. these findings raise the possibility that sapp770 can be a useful biomarker for acs.

829,"age and growth of atlantic sturgeon in the james river, virginia, 1997-2011. historically the chesapeake bay supported a large population of atlantic sturgeon acipenser oxyrinchus, but loss of suitable spawning habitat and overfishing coincided with dramatic in-system declines throughout the 20th century. atlantic sturgeon harvest moratoriums were implemented in 1974 for virginia waters and were expanded coastwide in 1998. in 1997, researchers became aware that commercial fishers in the james river, a tributary of the chesapeake bay, were catching juvenile and subadult atlantic sturgeon as bycatch in various fisheries. genetic studies showed that the chesapeake bay population has maintained genetic integrity and qualifies as a distinct population segment. between 2007 and 2011, almost 150 adults have been caught in the tidal-freshwater portion of the james river during putative spawning runs. pectoral fin spines from juveniles and subadults collected in the burwell bay (rkm 40) and cobham bay (rkm 60) areas and mature adult samples from vessel strikes in freshwater around or above rkm 120 were analyzed to create a length-at-age curve for atlantic sturgeon in the james river. five models were used to analyze the data, and the double von bertalanffy (k(1) = 0.054, k(2) = 0.097, t(1) = -2.85, t(2) = 1.09, t(p) = 6.03 years, l-infinity = 2241 mm) provided the best fit to the observed data. we estimated an increase in growth coefficient at t(p), which could be an artifact of low sample size or due to ontogenetic changes in habitat use as older fish spend more time in oceanic waters than younger fish. atlantic sturgeon in the 6-9 year age range are rarely encountered in the james river compared with younger and older age-classes, so a more in-depth analysis of the increased growth coefficient would require ocean sampling.

831,"presynaptic dysfunction in parkinson's disease: a focus on lrrk2. pd (parkinson's disease) is a common neurodegenerative disease clinically characterized by bradykinesia, rigidity and resting tremor. recent studies have proposed that synaptic dysfunction, implicated in numerous studies of animal models of pd, might be a key factor in pd. the molecular defects that lead to pd progression might be hidden at the presynaptic neuron: in fact accumulating evidence has shown that the majority of the genes linked to pd play a critical role at the presynaptic site. in the present paper, we focus on the presynaptic function of lrrk2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2), a protein that mutated represents the main genetic cause of familial pd described to date. neurotransmission relies on proper presynaptic vesicle trafficking; defects in this process, variation in dopamine flow and alteration of presynaptic plasticity have been reported in several animal models of lrrk2 mutations. furthermore, impaired dopamine turnover has been described in presymptomatic lrrk2 pd patients. thus, given the pathological events occurring at the synapses of pd patients, the presynaptic site may represent a promising target for early diagnostic therapeutic intervention.

833,"inhibition of paclitaxel-induced decreases in calcium signaling. peripheral neuropathy is one of the most severe and irreversible side effects caused by treatment from several chemotherapeutic drugs, including paclitaxel (taxol (r)) and vincristine. strategies are needed that inhibit this unwanted side effect without altering the chemotherapeutic action of these drugs. we previously identified two proteins in the cellular pathway that lead to taxol-induced peripheral neuropathy, neuronal calcium sensor-1 (ncs-1) and calpain. prolonged treatment with taxol induces activation of calpain, degradation of ncs-1, and loss of intracellular calcium signaling. this paper has focused on understanding the molecular basis for prevention of peripheral neuropathy by testing the effects of addition of two candidate compounds to the existing chemotherapeutic drug regime: lithium and ibudilast. we found that the co-administration of either lithium or ibudilast to neuroblastoma cells that were treated with taxol or vincristine inhibited activation of calpain and the reductions in ncs-1 levels and calcium signaling associated with these chemotherapeutic drugs. the ability of taxol to alter microtubule formation was unchanged by the addition of either candidate compound. these results allow us to suggest that it is possible to prevent the unnecessary and irreversible damage caused by chemotherapeutic drugs while still maintaining therapeutic efficacy. specifically, the addition of either lithium or ibudilast to existing chemotherapy treatment protocols has the potential to prevent chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.

834,"latent variables and route choice behavior. in the last decade, a broad array of disciplines has shown a general interest in enhancing discrete choice models by considering the incorporation of psychological factors affecting decision making. this paper provides insight into the comprehension of the determinants of route choice behavior by proposing and estimating a hybrid model that integrates latent variable and route choice models. data contain information about latent variable indicators and chosen routes of travelers driving regularly from home to work in an urban network. choice sets include alternative routes generated with a branch and bound algorithm. a hybrid model consists of measurement equations, which relate latent variables to measurement indicators and utilities to choice indicators, and structural equations, which link travelers' observable characteristics to latent variables and explanatory variables to utilities. estimation results illustrate that considering latent variables (i.e., memory, habit, familiarity, spatial ability, time saving skills) alongside traditional variables (e.g., travel time, distance, congestion level) enriches the comprehension of route choice behavior.

835,"compost admixture impact study on water infiltration depth, water front advance and recession in irrigated environment. water is an important life supporting resource and is essential for sustainable food production. its continued decrease has diverted the attention of researchers to find new ways of efficient irrigation management. decomposed bio-solids (for example leaves, crop residue, animal waste, municipal solid waste) form the compost and provide friendly environment for enhancing crop production. the present study investigates the effects of compost admixture on water infiltration depth, water advance and recession phase of irrigation event in the field having loamy sand texture. compost from two sources was used. there were nine experimental plots with 3.5 m width and 45 m length. compost at the rate of 5 % was incorporated up to a depth of 3 cm in six plots (3 plots of each compost source) and in the remaining three plots no compost was applied. the field was irrigated twice. the results revealed that by using 5% compost admixture by weight the advance time reduced by 23.96% and 26.83 % for 1st and 2nd irrigation, respectively compared to non compost admixture plots. results revealed that by using 5 % compost up to 3cm mixing depth the water infiltration depth decreased 42.97 % at head side of the field and 10.37 % at tail side of field during 1st irrigation, during 2nd irrigation the water infiltration depth decreased 48.67 % at upper end of the field and 11.28 % at lower end of the field. the significant decrease in water infiltration depth at head side gives uniformity in water infiltration depth along the length of field. the faster movement of the water front with the application of compost admixture reduces the difference in intake opportunity times between the head and far end of the field, thus it improves the performance of the irrigation system. reduction in the applied water volume to the tone of 23.96% during 1st irrigation and 26.83% during 2nd irrigation, further supports this improvement in irrigation performance, considering on the advance phase.

840,"quasi-monoenergetic tens-of-mev proton beams by a laser-illuminated funnel-like target. from numerical simulations, we study the generation of quasi-monoenergetic mev proton beams from a laser-illuminated funnel-like target. we show that, when passing through such a target, the laser beam can be focused and constricted within a cylindrical bore at the funnel apex from which proton beams are produced. accompanied by a much-enhanced laser intensity, the proton beams experience more acceleration time than with normal funnel targets. constriction from the cylinder bore, combined with an enhancement of a separated charge field from al electrons, protons can attain higher energies up to several tens of mev. at the same time, strong suppression of the transverse divergence of the laser and proton beams yields a localized, collimated, mono-energetic proton beam.

842,"structure of soybean beta-cyanoalanine synthase and the molecular basis for cyanide detoxification in plants. plants produce cyanide (cn-) during ethylene biosynthesis in the mitochondria and require beta-cyanoalanine synthase (cas) for cn- detoxification. recent studies show that cas is a member of the beta-substituted alanine synthase (bsas) family, which also includes the cys biosynthesis enzyme o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase (oass), but how the bsas evolved distinct metabolic functions is not understood. here we show that soybean (glycine max) cas and oass form alpha-aminoacrylate reaction intermediates from cys and o-acetylserine, respectively. to understand the molecular evolution of cas and oass in the bsas enzyme family, the crystal structures of gm-cas and the gm-cas k95a mutant with a linked pyridoxal phosphate (plp)-cys molecule in the active site were determined. these structures establish a common fold for the plant bsas family and reveal a substrate-induced conformational change that encloses the active site for catalysis. comparison of cas and oass identified residues that covary in the plp binding site. the gm-oass t81m, s181m, and t185s mutants altered the ratio of oass: cas activity but did not convert substrate preference to that of a cas. generation of a triple mutant gm-oass successfully switched reaction chemistry to that of a cas. this study provides new molecular insight into the evolution of diverse enzyme functions across the bsas family in plants.

844,"simultaneous targeting of src kinase and receptor tyrosine kinase results in synergistic inhibition of renal cell carcinoma proliferation and migration. there have been recent improvements in the treatment for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (rcc) with receptor tyrosine kinase (rtk) inhibitors being one of newer treatment options. we hypothesized that simultaneous targeting of src kinase and the rtk may have synergistic effects to further improve therapies on metastatic rcc. the effects of src kinase inhibitor saracatinib and multiple rtk inhibitor sunitinib on rcc cell line (achn) and caki-1 were studied. saracatinib alone or in combination with sunitinib inhibited the migration of achn and caki-1 cells in vitro. activation of migration related components fak, p130cas and paxillin were blocked by saracatinib at 0.05- to 3-mu m concentrations. combined treatment resulted in improved growth inhibition, greater loss of the s phase cell population and decreased clonogenic colony formation compared to sunitinib alone in the metastatic caki-1 line. molecular studies in caki-1 showed that saracatinib alone and in combination with sunitinib inhibited phosphorylation of the cell progression regulator c-myc in a dose-dependent manner. sunitinib alone or in combination suppressed cyclin-d1 expression with the combination showing greater dose-dependent effect. sunitinib inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) secretion through the inhibition of stat3 signaling and vegf biosynthesis. hif1-alpha expression in normoxic and hypoxic conditions in caki-1 cells was inhibited by either saracatinib or sunitinib when administered alone, however, a greater reduction occurred when these compounds were given in combination. targeting src kinase and rtk simultaneously with saracatinib and sunitinib resulted in 70-80% blockade of rcc cell migration, synergistic inhibition of cell growth and reduction of acquired drug resistance in caki-1 cells. the results show promise for combination targeted therapy of rcc.

845,"self-stigma and its relationship with insight, demoralization, and clinical outcome among people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. background: paradoxically, insight is associated with positive outcomes, such as better treatment adherence and recovery, and negative outcomes, such as depression, hopelessness, low self-esteem, and quality of life. self-stigma as a moderating variable can be decisive whether more insight leads to better or worse outcome. on the other hand, self-stigma can act as a mediator between insight and outcomes. we therefore examined self-stigma both as a moderator and a mediator. 
 methods: insight, self-stigma, demoralization, symptoms, and functioning were assessed among 145 outpatients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders using questionnaires and structured interviews. structural equation modeling was used to analyze the cross-sectional data. 
 results: results confirmed self-stigma as a moderator: the association of insight and demoralization was stronger as self-stigma increased. self-stigma also partially mediated the positive relationship between insight and demoralization. moreover, demoralization fully mediated the adverse associations of self-stigma with psychotic symptoms and global functioning. 
 discussion: given the decisive role of self-stigma regarding the detrimental consequences of insight, interventions should address self-stigma, particularly if psychoeducational or other interventions have increased insight. therapeutic implications for changes of dysfunctional beliefs related to illness and self and change of self-concept in the context of recovery at the level of narrative identity are discussed.

848,"preparation, structural and optical characterization of nanocrystalline zno doped with luminescent ag-nanoclusters. nanocrystalline zno doped with ag-nanoclusters has been synthesized by a salt solid state reaction. three overlapping broad emission bands due to the ag nanoclusters have been detected at about 570, 750 and 900 nm. these emission bands are excited by an energy transfer from the exciton state of the zno host when pumped in the wavelength range from 250 to 400 nm. the 900 nm emission band shows characteristic orbital splitting into three components pointing out that the anisotropic crystalline wurtzite host of zno is responsible for this feature. heat-treatment and temperature dependence studies confirm the origin of these emission bands. an energy level diagram for the emission process and a model for ag nanoclusters sites are suggested. the emission of nanocrystalline zno doped with ag nanoclusters may be applied for white light generation, displays driven by uv light, down-convertors for solar cells and luminescent lamps.

854,"effectiveness of soil n availability indices in predicting site productivity in the oil sands region of alberta. quantitative relationships between soil n availability indices and tree growth are lacking in the oil sands region of alberta and this can hinder the development of guidelines for the reclamation of the disturbed landscape after oil sands extraction. the aim of this paper was to establish quantitative relationships between soil n availability indices and tree growth in the oil sands region of alberta. 
 in situ n mineralization rates, in situ n availability measured in the field using plant root simulators (prs (tm) probes), laboratory aerobic and anaerobic soil n mineralization rates, and soil c/n and n content were determined for both the forest floor and the 0-20 cm mineral soil in eight jack pine (pinus banksiana lamb.) stands in the oil sands region in northern alberta. tree growth rates were determined based on changes in tree ring width in the last 6 years and as mean annual aboveground biomass increment. 
 soil n availability indices across those forest stands varied and for each stand it was several times higher in the forest floor than in the mineral soil. the in situ and laboratory aerobic and anaerobic soil n mineralization rates, soil mineralized n, in situ n availability measured using prs probes, soil c/n ratio and n content in both the forest floor and mineral soil, as well as stand age were linearly correlated with tree ring width of jack pine trees across the selected forest stands, consistent with patterns seen in other published studies and suggesting that n availability could be a limiting factor in the range of jack pine stands studied. 
 in situ and laboratory aerobic and anaerobic n mineralization rates and soil c/n ratio and n content can be used for predicting tree growth in jack pine forests in the oil sand region. laboratory based measurements such as aerobic and anaerobic n mineralization rates and soil c/n ratio and n content would be preferable as they are more cost effective and equally effective for predicting jack pine growth.

856,"submaximal ppar gamma activation and endothelial dysfunction: new perspectives for the management of cardiovascular disorders. ppar? activation plays an important role in glucose metabolism by enhancing insulin sensitization. ppar? is a primary target for thiazolidinedione-structured insulin sensitizers like pioglitazone and rosiglitazone employed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. additionally, ppar? activation inhibits adhesion cascades and detrimental vascular inflammatory events. importantly, activation of ppar? plays a distinctive role in regulating the physiology and expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (enos) in the endothelium, resulting in enhanced generation of vascular nitric oxide. the ppar? activation-mediated vascular anti-inflammatory and direct endothelial functional regulatory actions could, therefore, be beneficial in improving the vascular function in patients with atherosclerosis and hypertension with or without diabetes mellitus. despite the disappointing cardiac side effect profile of rosiglitazone-like ppar? full agonists, the therapeutic potential of novel pharmacological agents targeting ppar? submaximally cannot be ruled out. this review discusses the potential regulatory role of ppar? on enos expression and activation in improving the function of vascular endothelium. we argue that partial/submaximal activation of ppar? could be a major target for vascular endothelial functional improvement. interestingly, newly synthesized partial agonists of ppar? such as balaglitazone, mbx-102, mk-0533, par-1622, pam-1616, kr-62776 and sppar?m5 are devoid of or have a reduced tendency to cause the adverse effects associated with full agonists of ppar?. we propose that the vascular protective properties of pharmacological agents, which submaximally activate ppar?, should be investigated. moreover, the therapeutic opportunities of agents that submaximally activate ppar? in preventing vascular endothelial dysfunction (ved) and ved-associated cardiovascular disorders are discussed.

858,"an empirical study on the relationships between functional performance measure and task performance measure in npp mcr. in many industrial settings such as chemical plants and electrical power generating plants, operator performance measures have been used for multi-objectives such as control room design, human system interface evaluation, training and procedures. because of multiple uses of performance measures, many methods and criteria for measuring human performance have been developed. among these methods, functional performance measures and task performance measures are well known and widely used to measure human performance. although these two methods are used independently for many industries, and most studies related to operators' performance use one of these measures, there has been no research to directly identify the relationships between the two measures. 
 in this paper, task performance and functional performance measures are compared and investigated in terms of whether they have any relationships under the same interfacing system loss of coolant accident (isloca) scenario considered in the experiment. furthermore, to gain realistic results, these two performance measures are applied to nuclear power plant main control room (npp mcr) operators to measure their performances in a full-scope simulator. finally, a regression line plotting the relation between task and functional performance score and the correlation of the two performance measures are investigated.

862,"selective pulmonary artery perfusion with melphalan is equal to isolated lung perfusion but superior to intravenous melphalan for the treatment of sarcoma lung metastases in a rodent model. isolated lung perfusion (ilup) and selective pulmonary artery perfusion (spap) are experimental surgical techniques to deliver high-dose chemotherapy selectively to the lung for the treatment of lung metastases. ilup with melphalan (mn) has shown to be feasible in clinical studies but can only be used once because it is invasive. spap as an endovascular technique can be repeated several times, but no results have been reported so far. pharmacokinetics and efficacy of spap with mn were studied in a rodent lung metastasis model and compared it with ilup and intravenous (iv) therapy. 
 pharmacokinetics: forthy-five wag-rij rats were randomized into three groups: iv 0.5 mg mn, ilup 0.5 mg mn and spap 0.5 mg mn. every treatment group was again randomized in three groups: 15 min treatment, 30 min treatment and 30 min treatment with 30 min reperfusion. blood and tissue samples were taken for mn concentrations. efficacy: twenty-five wag-rij rats were randomized into five groups: control, sham thoracotomy, iv 0.5 mg mn, ilup 0.5 mg mn and spap 0.5 mg mn. at day 0, bilateral lung metastases were induced, and treatment followed at day 7. at day 28, rats were sacrificed and pulmonary metastases counted. survival: thirty wag-rij rats were randomized into five groups: control, sham ilup, iv 0.5 mg mn, ilup 0.5 mg mn, spap 0.5 mg mn. at day 0, left-sided lungmetastases were induced with treatment at day 7. endpoints were death due to disease or survival up to 90 days. 
 pharmacokinetics: spap and ilup resulted in significantly higher left lung mn concentrations compared with iv (p = 0.05). efficacy: spap (30 +/- 22 nodules) and ilup (20 +/- 9 nodules) resulted in significantly less nodules compared with iv (113 +/- 17 nodules; p &lt; 0.01). survival: median survival of spap (74 +/- 8 days) was equal to ilup mn (71 +/- 10 days) but significantly longer compared with iv (54 +/- 7 days; p &lt; 0.01 both). 
 spap with mn for the treatment of sarcoma lung metastases in rats is equally effective to ilup but resulted in a significantly better survival compared with iv mn. as spap can be applied as a minimally invasive endovascular procedure, continued research with this technique is warranted.

863,"theoretical study on the ground state structure of uranofullerene u@c-82. despite its experimental characterization, the detailed geometry and electronic structure of actinide metallofullerene u@c-82 have been rarely studied. we predict that c-#5(82) and c-#8(82) are the best cages for the encapsulation of monovalent and tetravalent u (i.e., u+ and u4+), respectively; while c-#9(82) is the best cage for divalent, trivalent, pentavalent, and hexavalent u cations (i.e., u2+, u3+, u5+, and u6+). u@c-#9(82) is the thermodynamically most stable one among all the isomers and thus corresponds to the most experimentally isolable isomer of u@c-82. the calculated spin density explicitly suggests that the endohedral metallofullerene u@c-#9(82) is a trivalent ion-pair with an electronic configuration of u3+@c-82(3-). the proposed geometry and electronic structure of u3+@c-#9(82)3- are in good agreement with the experimental observation.

864,"clinical application of exome sequencing in undiagnosed genetic conditions. background there is considerable interest in the use of next-generation sequencing to help diagnose unidentified genetic conditions, but it is difficult to predict the success rate in a clinical setting that includes patients with a broad range of phenotypic presentations. 
 methods the authors present a pilot programme of whole-exome sequencing on 12 patients with unexplained and apparent genetic conditions, along with their unaffected parents. unlike many previous studies, the authors did not seek patients with similar phenotypes, but rather enrolled any undiagnosed proband with an apparent genetic condition when predetermined criteria were met. 
 results this undertaking resulted in a likely genetic diagnosis in 6 of the 12 probands, including the identification of apparently causal mutations in four genes known to cause mendelian disease (tcf4, eftud2, scn2a and smad4) and one gene related to known mendelian disease genes (ngly1). of particular interest is that at the time of this study, eftud2 was not yet known as a mendelian disease gene but was nominated as a likely cause based on the observation of de novo mutations in two unrelated probands. in a seventh case with multiple disparate clinical features, the authors were able to identify homozygous mutations in efemp1 as a likely cause for macular degeneration (though likely not for other features). 
 conclusions this study provides evidence that next-generation sequencing can have high success rates in a clinical setting, but also highlights key challenges. it further suggests that the presentation of known mendelian conditions may be considerably broader than currently recognised.

865,"neutrophil cerebrovascular transmigration triggers rapid neurotoxicity through release of proteases associated with decondensed dna. cerebrovascular inflammation contributes to diverse cns disorders through mechanisms that are incompletely understood. the recruitment of neutrophils to the brain can contribute to neurotoxicity, particularly during acute brain injuries, such as cerebral ischemia, trauma, and seizures. however, the regulatory and effector mechanisms that underlie neutrophil-mediated neurotoxicity are poorly understood. in this study, we show that mouse neutrophils are not inherently toxic to neurons but that transendothelial migration across il-1-stimulated brain endothelium triggers neutrophils to acquire a neurotoxic phenotype that causes the rapid death of cultured neurons. neurotoxicity was induced by the addition of transmigrated neutrophils or conditioned medium, taken from transmigrated neutrophils, to neurons and was partially mediated by excitotoxic mechanisms and soluble proteins. transmigrated neutrophils also released decondensed dna associated with proteases, which are known as neutrophil extracellular traps. the blockade of histone-dna complexes attenuated transmigrated neutrophil-induced neuronal death, whereas the inhibition of key neutrophil proteases in the presence of transmigrated neutrophils rescued neuronal viability. we also show that neutrophil recruitment in the brain is il-1 dependent, and release of proteases and decondensed dna from recruited neutrophils in the brain occurs in several in vivo experimental models of neuroinflammation. these data reveal new regulatory and effector mechanisms of neutrophil-mediated neurotoxicity (i.e., the release of proteases and decondensed dna triggered by phenotypic transformation during cerebrovascular transmigration). such mechanisms have important implications for neuroinflammatory disorders, notably in the development of antileukocyte therapies. the journal of immunology, 2012, 189: 381-392.

870,"canonical and atypical e2fs regulate the mammalian endocycle. the endocycle is a variant cell cycle consisting of successive dna synthesis and gap phases that yield highly polyploid cells. although essential formetazoan development, relatively little is known about its control or physiologic role in mammals. using lineage-specific cre mice we identified two opposing arms of the e2f program, one driven by canonical transcription activation (e2f1, e2f2 and e2f3) and the other by atypical repression (e2f7 and e2f8), that converge on the regulation of endocycles in vivo. ablation of canonical activators in the two endocycling tissues of mammals, trophoblast giant cells in the placenta and hepatocytes in the liver, augmented genome ploidy, whereas ablation of atypical repressors diminished ploidy. these two antagonistic arms coordinate the expression of a unique g2/m transcriptional program that is critical for mitosis, karyokinesis and cytokinesis. these results provide in vivo evidence for a direct role of e2f family members in regulating non-traditional cell cycles in mammals.

872,"identification of new autoantigens by protein array indicates a role for il4 neutralization in autoimmune hepatitis. autoimmune hepatitis (aih) is an unresolving inflammation of the liver of unknown cause. diagnosis requires the exclusion of other conditions and the presence of characteristic features such as specific autoantibodies. presently, these autoantibodies have relatively low sensitivity and specificity and are identified via immunostaining of cells or tissues; therefore, there is a diagnostic need for better and easy-to-assess markers. to identify new aih-specific autoantigens, we developed a protein microarray comprising 1626 human recombinant proteins, selected in silico for being secreted or membrane associated. we screened sera from aih patients on this microarray and compared the reactivity with that of sera from healthy donors and patients with chronic viral hepatitis c. we identified six human proteins that are specifically recognized by aih sera. serum reactivity to a combination of four of these autoantigens allows identification of aih patients with high sensitivity (82%) and specificity (92%). of the six autoantigens, the interleukin-4 (il4) receptor fibronectin type iii domain of the il4 receptor (cd124), which is expressed on the surface of both lymphocytes and hepatocytes, showed the highest individual sensitivity and specificity for aih. remarkably, patients' sera inhibited stat6 phosphorylation induced by il4 binding to cd124, demonstrating that these autoantibodies are functional and suggesting that il4 neutralization has a pathogenetic role in aih. molecular &amp; cellular proteomics 11: 10.1074/mcp.m112.018713, 1885-1897, 2012.

874,"substantial genetic divergence between morphologically indistinguishable populations of fasciola suggests the possibility of cryptic speciation. the liver flukes, fasciola hepatica and fasciola gigantica, are considered to be sister species and between them present a major threat worldwide to livestock production. in this study sequence data have been employed from informative regions of the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of over 200 morphologically f. hepatica-like or f. gigantica-like flukes from europe, sub-saharan africa and south asia to assess genetic diversity. evidence is presented for the existence of four well-separated clades: african gigantica-like flukes, indian gigantica-like flukes. european hepatica-like flukes and african high-altitude hepatica-like flukes. application of the biological species concept to trematodes is problematic: however, the degree of separation between these groups was sufficient for them to be considered as distinct species using the four times rule for speciation.

875,"comparison of diclofenac sodium with indomethacin suppositories for mediolateral episiotomies. objective: the study was carried out to compare the analgesic effect of diclofenac sodium and indomethacin suppositories for management of right mediolateral episiotomy repair. method: a total of 70 patients who gave birth vaginally with right mediolateral episitomy were randomly assigned to receive 100 mg diclofenac sodium suppositories/day (g1, n = 35) or 100 mg indomethacin supposotories/day (g2, n = 35) after episiotomy repair and postpartum for three days. pain ratings were recorded before, the first hour and 24 hours after medication. the verbal rating scale (vrs) and visual analog scale (vas) were used for pain recording. the independent t test, mann-whitney u and wilcoxon rank test were used for statistical analysis and spearman correlation analysis was used for comparison between vrs and vas. results: diclofenac sodium was a more effective analgesic than indomethacin suppositories for right mediolateral episiotomy pain. for g1 the first hour vrs was 2.6 +/- 0.5 points and vas 4.9 +/- 0.8 points; for g2 the first hour vrs was 3.4 +/- 0.6 points vas 6.6 +/- 1.2 points; this difference was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05, mann-whitney u test). for g1 at the 24th hour vrs was 1.2 +/- 0.4 points and vas 2.4 +/- 0.9 points; for g2 at the 24th hour vrs was 2 +/- 0.7 points and vas was 3.4 +/- 1.3 points; the difference was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05, mann-whitney u test). the first and 24th hour pain scores (vas1-vas24, vrs1-vrs24) were decreased dramatically for both groups (p &lt; 0.05, wilcoxon rank test). a positive correlation was obtained between the first and 24th hour vrs and vas by spearman correlation analysis (r(s) = 0.9, n = 70, p = 0.000). conclusion: the two analgesics were effective after episiotomy repair, however diclofenac sodium suppositories may be the preferred choice because they were more effective.

879,"sensitivity to biases of case-control studies on medical procedures, particularly surgery and blood transfusion, and risk of creutzfeldt-jakob disease. background: evidence of risk of creutzfeldt-jakob disease (cjd) associated with medical procedures, including surgery and blood transfusion, is limited by susceptibility to bias in epidemiological studies. methods: sensitivity to bias was explored using a central-birth-cohort model using data from 18 case-control studies obtained after a review of 494 reports on medical procedures and risk of cjd, systematic for the period january 1, 1989 to december 31, 2011. results: the validity of the findings in these studies may have been undermined by: recall; control selection; exposure assessment in life-time periods of different duration, out of time-at-risk of effect, or asymmetry in case/control data; and confounding by concomitant blood transfusion at the time of surgery. for sporadic cjd (scjd), a history of surgery or blood transfusion was associated with risk in some, but not all, recent studies at a &gt;= 10 year lag time, when controls were longitudinally sampled. space-time aggregation of surgical events was not seen. surgery at early clinical onset might be overrepresented among cases. neither surgical history nor blood transfusion unlabelled for donor status, dental treatments or endoscopic examinations were linked to variant cjd (vcjd). conclusions: these results indicate the need for further research. common challenges within these studies include access to and content of past medical/dental treatment records for diseases with long incubation periods. copyright (c) 2012 s. karger ag, basel

880,"differential performance and parasitism of caterpillars on maize inbred lines with distinctly different herbivore-induced volatile emissions. plant volatiles induced by insect feeding are known to attract natural enemies of the herbivores. six maize inbred lines that showed distinctly different patterns of volatile emission in laboratory assays were planted in randomized plots in the central mexican highlands to test their ability to recruit parasitic wasps under field conditions. the plants were artificially infested with neonate larvae of the fall armyworm spodoptera frugiperda, and two of its main endoparasitoids, campoletis sonorensis and cotesia marginiventris, were released in the plots. volatiles were collected from equally treated reference plants in the neighbourhood of the experimental field. the cumulative amount of 36 quantified volatile compounds determined for each line was in good accordance with findings from the laboratory; there was an almost 15-fold difference in total emission between the two extreme lines. we found significant differences among the lines with respect to the numbers of armyworms recovered from the plants, their average weight gain and parasitism rates. average weight of the caterpillars was negatively correlated with the average total amount of volatiles released by the six inbred lines. however, neither total volatile emission nor any specific single compound within the blend could explain the differential parasitism rates among the lines, with the possible exception of (e)-2-hexenal for campoletis sonorensis and methyl salicylate for cotesia marginiventris. herbivore-induced plant volatiles and/or correlates thereof contribute to reducing insect damage of maize plants through direct plant defence and enhanced attraction of parasitoids, alleged indirect defence. the potential to exploit these volatiles for pest control deserves to be further evaluated.

881,"influence of serum leptin levels on future overweight risk in korean children. background and aims: leptin is an important regulator of energy metabolism. it is considered to be positively related to body adiposity and metabolic disorders in obese adults and children. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between baseline circulating leptin, insulin and adiponectin levels and future overweight and metabolic risks in a paediatric population-based cohort. 
 methods and results: first-grade students, who entered elementary school at age 7 years in gwacheon, a korean city, were enrolled in this cohort study, and followed from 1st grade to 5th grade. annual physical examinations from 2005 to 2009 were performed. in 2006, the levels of serum glucose, insulin, leptin and adiponectin and lipid profiles were examined. in 2008, the above parameters, except for adiponectin, were measured again in 381 children (202 boys and 179 girls) who participated. in 2006, 10.2% of the children were overweight (body mass index (bmi) &gt;= 85th percentile), and after 2 years, an additional 3% became overweight. compared with insulin and adiponectin, leptin was most highly associated with current and future bmi, and percent body fat. boys in the highest tertile for initial leptin (t3) showed the highest prevalence of overweight and metabolic risk scores among three leptin tertile groups. girls showed the same trends as boys. high initial leptin levels could be predictive of greater future bmi and metabolic risk score (p &lt; 0.001). 
 conclusion: these results suggest that elevated serum leptin concentrations among the childhood population could be a marker for future bmi and metabolic disorders. (c) 2010 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.

884,"single-neuron responses in the human nucleus accumbens during a financial decision-making task. linking values to actions and evaluating expectations relative to outcomes are both central to reinforcement learningandarethoughtto underlie financial decision-making. however, neurophysiology studies of these processes in humans remain limited. here, we recorded the activity of single human nucleus accumbens neurons while subjects performed a gambling task. we show that the nucleus accumbens encodes two signals related to subject behavior. first, we find that under relatively predictable conditions, single neuronal activity predicts future financial decisions on a trial-by-trial basis. interestingly, we show that this activity continues to predict decisions even under conditions of uncertainty (e. g., when the probability of winning or losing is 50/50 and no particular financial choice predicts a rewarding outcome). furthermore, we find that this activity occurs, on average, 2 s before the subjects physically manifest their decision. second, we find that the nucleus accumbens encodes the difference between expectedandrealized outcomes, consistent with a prediction error signal. we show this activity occurs immediately after the subject has realized the outcome of the trial and is present on both the individual and population neuron levels. these results provide human single neuronal evidence that the nucleus accumbens is integral in making financial decisions.

885,"biliary strictures after orthotopic liver transplantation: long-term results of percutaneous treatment in patients with nonfeasible endoscopic therapy. purpose. the aim of this study was to evaluate our experience with percutaneous treatment of biliary strictures after orthotopic liver transplantation in adult patients without the endoscopic access possibility and to evaluate the technical outcomes and long-term clinical results of this treatment. 
 materials and methods. thirty percutaneous procedures were performed in adult liver transplant recipients (13 men, 17 women, mean age 46.4 years) in our institution between 1996 and 2010. patients were treated with balloon dilatation and biliary duct drainage due to anastomotic stenosis (n = 20), nonanastomotic stenosis (n = 7), or due to stenosis caused by lymphoproliferation (n = 3). the percutaneous procedure was the first line of treatment due to hepaticojejunoanastomosis (n = 18) or after unsuccessful endoscopic therapy (n = 12). 
 results. technical success was achieved in 27 patients (90%). the remaining three patients only achieved external drainage with subsequent surgery. there were two complications (6.3%). long-term clinical success, defined as the absence of clinical, laboratory, or sonographic signs of stricture recurrence was achieved in 22 patients (73.3%) for a mean follow-up of 5.8 years. 
 conclusion. percutaneous treatment-balloon dilatation and biliary duct drainage-is a first-line option to manage biliary duct strictures in liver recipient, when endoscopic treatment is not possible or unsuccessful. it has a high technical success rate and low complication rate with favorable long-term results.

888,"nmd: a multifaceted response to premature translational termination. although most mrna molecules derived from protein-coding genes are destined to be translated into functional polypeptides, some are eliminated by cellular quality control pathways that collectively perform the task of mrna surveillance. in the nonsense-mediated decay (nmd) pathway premature translation termination promotes the recruitment of a set of factors that destabilize a targeted mrna. the same factors also seem to have key roles in repressing the translation of the mrna, dissociating its terminating ribosome and messenger ribonucleoproteins (mrnps), promoting the degradation of its truncated polypeptide product and possibly even feeding back to the site of transcription to interfere with splicing of the primary transcript.

889,"new approaches for studying the chemical diversity of natural resources and the bioactivity of their constituents. natural products (nps) have historically been an important source of lead molecules in drug discovery. however, the interest that the pharmaceutical industry has had in nps has declined in part because of the lack of compatibility of traditional natural-product extract libraries with high-throughput screenings and the low hit rate. furthermore, in contrast to the synthetic libraries, compounds from natural sources are likely to have complex structures which slow down the identification process and contribute to problems related to supply and manufacturing. in this paper, we summarise some of the strategies that are being developed in our research unit to address these issues. on one hand, differential screening strategies were established with the aim of identifying dynamically induced nps from silent biosynthetic pathways in plants and fungi that had been exposed to different stress situations. on the other hand, high-resolution hplc techniques were optimised for biological and chemical profiling of crude extracts. this led to an integrated platform for rapid and efficient identification of new drug-leads and biomarkers of interest that were based on miniaturised technological approaches and metabolomics.

891,"a plasmonic staircase nano-antenna device with strong electric field enhancement for surface enhanced raman scattering (sers) applications. in this paper, a staircase plasmonic nano-antenna device is analysed both theoretically and experimentally. the tapered nano-antenna cavity with a grating leads to electric field enhancement factor (ef) as high as 31 close to 830 nm. the integration of a metallic grating aids the coupling of light coming from the vertical direction to the nano-antenna, increasing the electric field in the nano-antenna by a factor of 3. the smallest air gap width between the metallic regions of the fabricated nano-antenna is about 35 nm, fabricated using focused ion beam system. the small air gaps in the nano-antennas can generate very high intensity electric fields which can be used in applications in biological sensing and imaging, nanoparticle manipulations and enhancement of nonlinear effects. in this paper, to experimentally demonstrate that with the integration of a well designed grating and reflectors, the resonance inside the nano-antenna cavity is increased significantly, we exploit one application of this device: the enhancement of surface enhanced raman scattering (sers). the present structure can lead to sers efs above 1 million.

893,"crohn's disease and genetic hitchhiking at ibd5. inflammatory bowel disease 5 (ibd5) is a 250 kb haplotype on chromosome 5 that is associated with an increased risk of crohn's disease in europeans. the octn1 gene is centrally located on ibd5 and encodes a transporter of the antioxidant ergothioneine (et). the 503f variant of octn1 is strongly associated with ibd5 and is a gain-of-function mutation that increases absorption of et. although 503f has been implicated as the variant potentially responsible for crohn's disease susceptibility at ibd5, there is little evidence beyond statistical association to support its role in disease causation. we hypothesize that 503f is a recent adaptation in europeans that swept to relatively high frequency and that disease association at ibd5 results not from 503f itself, but from one or more nearby hitchhiking variants, in the genes irf1 or il5. to test for evidence of recent positive selection on the 503f allele, we employed the ihs statistic, which was significant in the european ceu hapmap population (p = 0.0007) and european human genome diversity panel populations (p &lt; 0.01). to evaluate the hypothesis of disease-variant hitchhiking, we performed haplotype association tests on high-density microarray data in a sample of 1,868 crohn's disease cases and 5,550 controls. we found that 503f haplotypes with recombination breakpoints between octn1 and irf1 or il5 were not associated with disease (odds ratio [or]: 1.05, p = 0.21). in contrast, we observed strong disease association for 503f haplotypes with no recombination between these three genes (or: 1.24, p = 2.6 x 10(-8)), as expected if the sweeping haplotype harbored one or more disease-causing mutations in irf1 or il5. to further evaluate these disease-gene candidates, we obtained expression data from lower gastrointestinal biopsies of healthy individuals and crohn's disease patients. we observed a 72% increase in gene expression of irf1 among crohn's disease patients (p = 0.0006) and no significant difference in expression of octn1. collectively, these data indicate that the 503f variant has increased in frequency due to recent positive selection and that disease-causing variants in linkage disequilibrium with 503f have hitchhiked to relatively high frequency, thus forming the ibd5 risk haplotype. finally, our association results and expression data support irf1 as a strong candidate for crohn's disease causation.

895,"identification of high oleic castor seeds by near infrared reflectance spectroscopy. castor oil contains a high proportion (&gt;80%) of the unusual hydroxy fatty acid ricinoleic acid. additionally, a mutant with high oleic acid content (&gt;70%) has been developed. both fatty acids differ in the presence of an oh group in the c18 tail (ricinoleic acid). the objective of this research was to evaluate whether near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (nirs) can be used to discriminate between high oleic and high ricinoleic acid seeds. eight hundred and seventy-two individual seeds collected in 2008, 688 high ricinoleic and 184 high oleic, were scanned by nirs and further analyzed by glc. as high oleic/low ricinoleic acid content is recessive and no intermediate fatty acid levels occur, the spectral data was subjected to linear discriminant analysis, which correctly classified all the seeds. the discriminant function was validated with a set of 637 seeds collected in 2009 from segregating populations, which were correctly classified in all cases. nirs discrimination between oleic and ricinoleic acid was mainly based on spectral regions around 1,400 and 1,914 nm, putatively associated with the absorbance of the oh group. the results confirmed that nirs provides an effective means of discriminating between high oleic and high ricinoleic acid seeds.

 main outcome measure(s): cycle dating using blood markers; microarrays on laser microdissected glands and stroma; dual platform microarray confirmation; immunohistochemical analysis of cell cycle proteins. 
 result(s): the two microarray platforms showed concordance. during the window of implantation, a statistically significant network of 22 mrna associated with the cell cycle was down-regulated. immunohistochemistry identified altered localization in stroma. 
 conclusion(s): microarrays demonstrated glands and stroma have distinct mrna signatures, each dependent on the day of the cycle. we characterized two compartments of the receptive endometrium with a transcriptomic signature identifying regulation of only the cell cycle. immunohistochemical analysis of cell cycle proteins identified a signature staining pattern of nuclear relocalization of a group of cyclins of stromal cells, which may be clinically applicable.

900,"effects of isoflurane anesthesia with and without dexmedetomidine or remifentanil on quantitative electroencephalographic variables before and after nociceptive stimulation in dogs. objective-to evaluate the influence of various anesthetic protocols and 3 multiples of isoflurane minimum alveolar concentration (mac) before and after supramaximal stimulation on electroencephalographic (eeg) variables in dogs. 
 animals-6 healthy adult beagles (mean +/- sd body weight, 16.3 +/- 1.0 kg). 
 procedures-all dogs underwent 3 anesthesia sessions with a minimum of 1 week separating sessions: isoflurane alone, isoflurane and a constant rate infusion of dexmedetomidine (3 mu g/kg/h, iv; id), and isoflurane and a constant rate infusion of remifentanil (18 mu g/kg/h, iv; ir). the mac of isoflurane was determined via supramaximal electrical stimulation. quantitative variables (frequency bands and their ratios, median frequency, 95% spectral edge frequency [sef], and an eeg index) were determined directly before and after supramaximal stimulation at 0.75, 1.0, and 1.5 times the mac for each session of 20-second epochs. 
 results-mean +/- sd isoflurane macs for isoflurane alone, id, and ir were 1.7 +/- 0.3%, 1.0 +/- 0.1%, and 1.0 +/- 0.1%, respectively. prestimulation 95% see decreased significantly with increasing mac during the isoflurane alone and id sessions. significant decreases in delta frequency band (0.5 to 3.5 hz) presence and significant increases in beta frequency band (&gt; 12.5 hz) presence, median frequency, and 95% sef after stimulation were dependent on the mac and anesthetic protocol. the eeg index had the strongest correlation with increasing mac during the isoflurane-alone session (rho = -0.89) and the least in the ir session (rho = -0.15). 
 conclusions and clinical relevance-anesthesia with isoflurane alone resulted in the greatest overall eeg depression of all protocols. use of remifentanil depressed the eeg response to nociceptive stimulation more strongly than did dexmedetomidine. the eeg variables evaluated did not appear useful when used alone as indicators of anesthetic depth in dogs.

901,"human intracranial recordings and cognitive neuroscience. the ultimate goal of neuroscience research is to understand the operating mechanism of the human brain and to exploit this understanding to devise methods for repair when it malfunctions. a key feature of this operating mechanism is electrical activity of single brain cells and cell assemblies. for obvious ethical reasons, scientists rely mostly on animal research in the study of such signals. research in humans is often limited to electrical signals that can be recorded at the scalp or to surrogates of electrical activity, namely magnetic source imaging and measures of regional; blood flow and metabolism. invasive brain recordings performed in patients during various clinical procedures provide a unique opportunity to record high-resolution signals in vivo from the human brain-data that are otherwise unavailable. of special value are the rare opportunities to record in awake humans the activity of single brain cells and small cellular assemblies. these recordings provide a unique view on aspects of human cognition that are impossible to study in animals, including language, imagery, episodic memory, volition, and even consciousness.,in the current review we discuss the unique contribution of invasive recordings from patients to the field of cognitive neuroscience.

902,"transient receptor potential genes, smoking, occupational exposures and cough in adults. background: transient receptor potential (trp) vanilloid and ankyrin cation channels are activated by various noxious chemicals and may play an important role in the pathogenesis of cough. the aim was to study the influence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in trp genes and irritant exposures on cough. 
 methods: nocturnal, usual, and chronic cough, smoking, and job history were obtained by questionnaire in 844 asthmatic and 2046 non-asthmatic adults from the epidemiological study on the genetics and environment of asthma (egea) and the european community respiratory health survey (ecrhs). occupational exposures to vapors, gases, dusts, and/or fumes were assessed by a job-exposure matrix. fifty-eight tagging snps in trpv1, trpv4, and trpa1 were tested under an additive model. 
 results: statistically significant associations of 6 trpv1 snps with cough symptoms were found in non-asthmatics after correction for multiple comparisons. results were consistent across the eight countries examined. haplotype-based association analysis confirmed the single snp analyses for nocturnal cough (7-snp haplotype: p-global = 4.8 x 10(-6)) and usual cough (9-snp haplotype: p-global = 4.5 x 10(-6)). cough symptoms were associated with exposure to irritants such as cigarette smoke and occupational exposures (p &lt; 0.05). four polymorphisms in trpv1 further increased the risk of cough symptoms from irritant exposures in asthmatics and non-asthmatics (interaction p &lt; 0.05). 
 conclusions: trpv1 snps were associated with cough among subjects without asthma from two independent studies in eight european countries. trpv1 snps may enhance susceptibility to cough in current smokers and in subjects with a history of workplace exposures.

905,"heritability of cortisol response to confinement stress in european sea bass dicentrarchus labrax. background: in fish, the most studied production traits in terms of heritability are body weight or growth, stress or disease resistance, while heritability of cortisol levels, widely used as a measure of response to stress, is less studied. in this study, we have estimated heritabilities of two growth traits (body weight and length) and of cortisol response to confinement stress in the european sea bass. 
 findings: the f1 progeny analysed (n = 922) belonged to a small effective breeding population with contributions from an unbalanced family structure of just 10 males and 2 females. heritability values ranged from 0.54 (+/- 0.21) for body weight to 0.65 (+/- 0.22) for standard body length and were low for cortisol response i.e. 0.08 (+/- 0.06). genetic correlations were positive (0.94) between standard body length and body weight and negative between cortisol and body weight and between cortisol and standard body length (-0.60 and -0.55, respectively). 
 conclusion: this study confirms that in european sea bass, heritability of growth-related traits is high and that selection on such traits has potential. however, heritability of cortisol response to stress is low in european sea bass and since it is known to vary greatly among species, further studies are necessary to understand the reasons for these differences.

908,"mild-to-moderate functional tricuspid regurgitation in patients undergoing valve replacement for rheumatic mitral disease: the influence of tricuspid valve repair on clinical and echocardiographic outcomes. background the decision to repair mild-to-moderate functional tricuspid regurgitation (tr) during left-side heart surgery remains controversial. 
 objectives to avoid heterogeneity in patient population, patients with tr undergoing isolated mechanical mitral valve (mv) replacement for rheumatic mitral diseases were evaluated. 
 methods between 1997 and 2009, 236 patients with mild-to-moderate functional tr underwent first-time isolated mechanical mv replacement for rheumatic mitral diseases with (n=123; repair group) or without (n=113; non-repair group) tricuspid valve (tv) repair. survival, valve-related complications, and tv function in these two groups were compared after adjustment for baseline characteristics using inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting. 
 results follow-up was complete in 225 patients (95.3%) with a median follow-up of 48.7 months (iqr 20.2-89.5 months), during which time 991 echocardiographic assessments were done. freedom from moderate-to-severe tr at 5 years was 92.9 +/- 2.9% in the repair group and 60.8 +/- 6.9% in the non-repair group (p&lt;0.001 and 0.048 in crude and adjusted analyses, respectively). after adjustment, both groups had similar risks of death (hr=0.57, p=0.43), tricuspid reoperation (hr=0.10, p=0.080) and congestive heart failure (hr=1.12, p=0.87). postoperative moderate-to-severe tr was an independent predictor of poorer event-free survival (hr=2.90, p=0.038). 
 conclusions these findings support the strategy of correcting mild-to-moderate functional tr at the time of mv replacement to maintain tv function and improve clinical outcomes.

909,"upper set monoids and length preserving morphisms. length preserving morphisms and inverse of substitutions are two well-studied operations on regular languages. their connection with varieties generated by power monoids was established independently by reutenauer and straubing in 1979. more recently, an ordered version of this theory was proposed by polak and by the authors. in this paper, we present an improved version of these results and obtain the following consequences. given a variety of finite ordered monoids v. let p up arrow v be the variety of finite ordered monoids generated by the upper set monoids of members of v. then p up arrow (p up arrow v) = p up arrow v. this contrasts with the known results for the unordered case: the operator pv corresponding to power monoids satisfies (pv)-v-3 = (pv)-v-4, but the varieties v, pv, (pv)-v-2 and (pv)-v-3 can be distinct.

910,"dynamic imaging by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy identifies diverse populations of polyglutamine oligomers formed in vivo. protein misfolding and aggregation are exacerbated by aging and diseases of protein conformation including neurodegeneration, metabolic diseases, and cancer. in the cellular environment, aggregates can exist as discrete entities, or heterogeneous complexes of diverse solubility and conformational state. in this study, we have examined the in vivo dynamics of aggregation using imaging methods including fluorescence microscopy, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (frap), and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (fcs), to monitor the diverse biophysical states of expanded polyglutamine (polyq) proteins expressed in caenorhabditis elegans. we show that monomers, oligomers and aggregates co-exist at different concentrations in young and aged animals expressing different polyq-lengths. during aging, when aggregation and toxicity are exacerbated, fcs-based burst analysis and purified single molecule fcs detected a populational shift toward an increase in the frequency of brighter and larger oligomeric species. regardless of age or polyq-length, oligomers were maintained in a heterogeneous distribution that spans multiple orders of magnitude in brightness. we employed genetic suppressors that prevent polyq aggregation and observed a reduction in visible immobile species with the persistence of heterogeneous oligomers, yet our analysis did not detect the appearance of any discrete oligomeric states associated with toxicity. these studies reveal that the reversible transition from monomers to immobile aggregates is not represented by discrete oligomeric states, but rather suggests that the process of aggregation involves a more complex pattern of molecular interactions of diverse intermediate species that can appear in vivo and contribute to aggregate formation and toxicity.

916,"thyroid hormone analogue stimulates keratinocyte proliferation but inhibits cell differentiation in epidermis. gross clinical manifestations of thyroid hormone (th) imbalance are often first seen in the skin where th plays an integral role in sustaining natural function. although mounting evidence suggests that th plays an important role in epidermal proliferation and wound healing, the physiologic role of thyroid hormone in skin is not well understood. in the current study, we investigated the effect of a natural thyroid hormone analogue - 3, 3', 5-triiodo-thyroacetic acid (triac) on regulating proliferation and differentiation and its possible molecular mechanism in normal human epidermal keratinocytes and c57bl/6 mice. we determined that triac could stimulate epidermal thickening in mice and promote human keratinocyte proliferation by activating cyclin d1 expression and promoting entrance into s phase. moreover, triac might inhibit cell differentiation through repressing the expression of casein kinase 1 (ck1), which is a key regulatory protein involved in the control of cell differentiation. taken together, our data explored the physiologic effect of triac on skin and the possible molecular mechanism of triac, which might be an interesting compound for the treatment of hyperkeratotic skin disorders.

922,"relationships between hippocampal shape and cognitive performances in drug-naive patients with alzheimer's disease. previous studies provided hippocampal shape analysis of alzheimer's disease (ad) patients using automated segmentation techniques. however, the relationships between the hippocampal deformations and various cognitive impairments were not clear. the aim of this study was to investigate hippocampal shape changes and their relationship to cognitive impairments. 
 fifty-one drug-naive patients with ad and 50 group-matched healthy control subjects underwent 3t mri scanning, and the hippocampal volumes and deformations were compared between the groups. additionally, we explored the correlation pattern between the hippocampal deformations and the cognitive dysfunctions in ad using the korean version of the consortium to establish a registry for alzheimer's disease (cerad-k). 
 ad subjects exhibited significant hippocampal deformations in the cornu ammnonis (ca1) and subiculum areas compared to those in healthy subjects (p &lt; 0.05. false discovery rate (fdr) corrected). significant correlations were observed between hippocampal deformations in ca1 and subiculum areas and verbal immediate recall, verbal delayed recall, verbal recognition memory, and constructional recall scores (p &lt; 0.05, fdr corrected). 
 this study was the first to explore the relationships between hippocampal deformations and various cognitive impairments of drug-naive patients with ad. 
 these structural changes in hippocampal ca1 and subiculum areas might be the core of the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of hippocampal dysfunction and their relevance to the various cognitive dysfunctions in ad. (c) 2012 elsevier ireland ltd. all rights reserved.

924,"throughput scaling of convolution for error-tolerant multimedia applications. convolution and cross-correlation are the basis of filtering and pattern or template matching in multimedia signal processing. we propose two throughput scaling options for any one-dimensional convolution kernel in programmable processors by adjusting the imprecision (distortion) of computation. our approach is based on scalar quantization, followed by two forms of tight packing in floating-point (one of which is proposed in this paper) that allow for concurrent calculation of multiple results. we illustrate how our approach can operate as an optional pre- and post-processing layer for off-the-shelf optimized convolution routines. this is useful for multimedia applications that are tolerant to processing imprecision and for cases where the input signals are inherently noisy (error tolerant multimedia applications). indicative experimental results with a digital music matching system and an mpeg-7 audio descriptor system demonstrate that the proposed approach offers up to 175% increase in processing throughput against optimized (full-precision) convolution with virtually no effect in the accuracy of the results. based on marginal statistics of the input data, it is also shown how the throughput and distortion can be adjusted per input block of samples under constraints on the signal-to-noise ratio against the full-precision convolution.

925,"linear analysis of the richtmyer-meshkov instability in shock-flame interactions. shock-flame interactions enhance supersonic mixing and detonation formation. therefore, their analysis is important to explosion safety, internal combustion engine performance, and supersonic combustor design. the fundamental process at the basis of the interaction is the richtmyer-meshkov instability supported by the density difference between burnt and fresh mixtures. in the present study we analyze the effect of reactivity on the richtmyer-meshkov instability with particular emphasis on combustion lengths that typify the scaling between perturbation growth and induction. the results of the present linear analysis study show that reactivity changes the perturbation growth rate by developing a pressure gradient at the flame surface. the baroclinic torque based on the density gradient across the flame acts to slow down the instability growth of high wave-number perturbations. a gasdynamic flame representation leads to the definition of a peclet number representing the scaling between perturbation and thermal diffusion lengths within the flame. peclet number effects on perturbation growth are observed to be marginal. the gasdynamic model also considers a finite flame mach number that supports a separation between flame and contact discontinuity. such a separation destabilizes the interface growth by augmenting the tangential shear.

928,"improving the charmm force field for polyunsaturated fatty acid chains. charmm36 (c36) is the most up-to-date pairwise additive all-atom lipid force field and is able to accurately represent bilayer properties of saturated and monounsaturated lipid molecules in the natural constant particle, pressure, and temperature (npt) ensemble. however, molecular dynamics (md) simulations on 1-stearoy1-2-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycerco-3-phosphocholine (sdpc) bilayers of the polyunsaturated fatty acid (pupa) chains result in inaccuracies of the surface area per lipid (sa), deuterium order parameters (s-cd), and x-ray form factors. therefore, in this study, high-level quantum mechanical calculations are used to improve the dihedral potential of neighboring double bonds, and the corresponding force field is referred to as c36p. the sa for sdpc at 303 k increases from 63.2 +/- 0.2 (c36) to 70.8 +/- 0.2 (c36p) angstrom(2) and agrees favorably with x-ray diffraction results at 297 k. the resulting s-cd are in excellent agreement with experimental values of both the sn-1 and sn-2 chains. calculated nmr c-13 relaxation times and x-ray form factors from md simulations of sdpc bilayers also agree with experiments. md simulations of 1,2-diarachidonyl-phosphatidylcholine (dapc) bilayers are used to further validate our force field parameters on a lipid with both chains containing pufas. as expected, the thickness of dapc bilayers is reduced, and the sa is increased compared to the sdpc bilayers. this update in the pupa force field should allow for accurate md simulations of pufa-containing bilayers in the npt ensemble.

 from may 2005 to august 2006, 15 patients received a 250 mg/day dosage of gefitinib after having disease progression while taking erlotinib at a dose of 150 mg/day. 
 among patients who received erlotinib, 1 (7%) achieved a partial response (pr), and 5 (33%) achieved stable disease (sd). among patients who received gefitinib, none achieved a pr, and 6 achieved sd (40%). five out of 6 patients who achieved pr/sd with erlotinib also achieved sd with gefitinib; 8 out of 9 patients who achieved a progressive disease (pd) with erlotinib also achieved a pd with gefitinib. the median time to progression (ttp) and overall survival (os) were 2.3 and 3.5 months, respectively. the ttp and os in sd patients were 3.7 and 7.4 months, respectively. the most common toxicities of gefitinib were dry skin (grade 1-2) in 27% of patients and acneiform rashes and rashes/desquamation in 20% of patients. diarrhea (grade 1-2) occurred in 7% of patients. 
 our data suggest that patients who achieved pr/sd with erlotinib also benefit from taking gefitinib. conversely, gefitinib is not recommended in patients whose disease progressed after taking erlotinib.

931,"an easy method for cutting and fluorescent staining of thin roots. cutting plant material is essential for observing internal structures and may be difficult for various reasons. most fixation agents such as aldehydes, as well as embedding resins, do not allow subsequent use of fluorescent staining and make material too soft to make good-quality hand-sections. moreover, cutting thin roots can be very difficult and time consuming. a new, fast and effective method to provide good-quality sections and fluorescent staining of fresh or fixed root samples, including those of very thin roots (such as arabidopsis or noccaea), is described here. 
 to overcome the above-mentioned difficulties the following procedure is proposed: fixation in methanol (when fresh material cannot be used) followed by en bloc staining with toluidine blue, embedding in 6 agarose, preparation of free-hand sections of embedded material, staining with fluorescent dye, and observation in a microscope under uv light. 
 despite eventual slight deformation of primary cell walls (depending on the species and root developmental stage), this method allows effective observation of different structures such as ontogenetic changes of cells along the root axis, e.g. development of xylem elements, deposition of casparian bands and suberin lamellae in endodermis or exodermis or peri-endodermal thickenings in noccaea roots. 
 this method provides good-quality sections and allows relatively rapid detection of cell-wall modifications. also important is the possibility of using this method for free-hand cutting of extremely thin roots such as those of arabidopsis.

932,"rainfall variability and vegetation dynamics of the lower limpopo valley, southern africa, 500 ad to present. the long-term responses of vegetation to climate variability are of relevance for predicting present and future vegetation change, and have implications for the management of savanna and riparian ecosystems. this paper explores the links between regional rainfall, hydrology and vegetation dynamics in the savannas and riverine forests of the lower limpopo valley, southern africa, from 800 ad to the present, reviewing palaeoecological data (fossil pollen, spores, diatoms and lithology) from several hydrological systems in kruger national park (knp), south africa and limpopo national park (pnl), mozambique. the pnl-knp records show that riverine arboreal taxa expanded during wetter periods, including 800-1400 ad and after 1800 ad. between 1400 and 1800 ad, grasses, savanna taxa and generalist taxa were favored over riparian taxa, a change that is linked with the onset of dry spells in the region (corresponding to the so-called little ice age). the most extreme drought events around 1700 ad resulted in a marked decline of riparian forest taxa near lake mapimbi, knp. in contrast, many water-scarce sequences away from the riverine environment, such as radio pan, mafayeni pan, malahlapanga pan and lake makwadzi show stable grassland vegetation throughout the last 1200 years. the results demonstrate the resilience of the grassland-savanna ecosystems to projected climate change with warmer and overall drier climate. the riverine forests are predicted to be more vulnerable especially as more extreme weather events are projected.

934,"optimization of the uvp plus pd rheometric method for flow behavior monitoring of industrial fluid suspensions. ultrasonic velocity profiling (uvp) is a powerful technique for velocity profile measurements in research and engineering applications as it is the only available method that is cost-effective, relatively easy to implement and applicable to opaque fluid suspensions, which are frequently found in industry. uvp can also be combined with pressure drop (pd) measurements in order to obtain rheological parameters of non-newtonian fluids by fitting theoretical rheological models to a single velocity profile measurement. the flow properties of complex fluids are almost exclusively obtained today using commercially available instruments, such as conventional rotational rheometers or tube (capillary) viscometers. since these methods are time-consuming and unsuitable for real-time process monitoring, the uvp+pd methodology becomes a very attractive alternative for in-line flow behavior monitoring as well as quality control in industrial applications. however, the accuracy of the uvp+pd methodology is highly dependent on the shape and magnitude of the measured velocity profiles and there are still a few problems remaining with current instrumentation and methods in order to achieve the robustness and accuracy required in industrial applications. the main objective of this research work was to optimize an uvp+pd system by implementing new transducer technology and signal processing techniques for more accurate velocity profile measurements as well as rheological characterization of complex fluids under industrial/realistic conditions. the new methodology was evaluated in two different pipe diameters (22.5 and 52.8 mm) and tested with three different non-newtonian fluids in order to obtain a wide range of rheological parameters. results were also compared to conventional rotational rheometry and tube viscometry. it was found that rheological parameters obtained from accurate velocity data across the pipe radius, especially close to pipe walls where the velocity gradient is high, showed better agreement to conventional rheometry than when compared to results obtained using profiles measured with conventional uvp instrumentation and commercial software (met-flow sa version 3.0). the uvp+pd method is now more robust and accurate. the main challenge remaining is to successfully implement a complete non-invasive system in industrial processes that is able to achieve real-time and accurate complex flow monitoring of non-newtonian fluid suspensions.

935,"investigation of the interaction between the mir-503 and cd40 genes in irradiated u937 cells. background: micrornas (mirnas) are a group of small noncoding rnas that take part in diverse biological processes by suppressing target gene expression. relatively few mirnas have been studied in detail, especially mir-503, and hence the biological relevance of majority remains to be uncovered. whether altered expression of mirna-503 affects the immunity response to radiotherapy has yet to be addressed. 
 results: in the present study, we applied ionizing radiation with a dose of either 0.1 gy or 5 gy to irradiate u937 cells to confirm cd40 as a mir-503 target, which was identified using a bioimformatics tool. in high dose (5 gy) ionizing-irradiated u937 cells, expression of mir-503 was up regulated while the expression of cd40 gene was down regulated. using the transfection of the mir-503 gene into u937 cells and luciferase assay, we confirmed that mir-503 suppressed the expression of cd40, and was a negtive regulator of cd40. 
 conclusions: to our knowledge, we are the first to describe involvement of mir-503 in radiobiological effect at a molecular level. this initial finding suggested the evidence that ionizing radiation could alter the expression of mir-503 and its target gene cd40, and may be very important to shed light on a possible mechanism regarding regulation of immune responses to irradiation.

 methods/results deep sequencing of this 30 mb region enriched with array capture in five affected individuals from four chinese pkc families detected two heterozygous prrt2 insertions (c.369dupg and c.649dupc), producing frameshifts and premature stop codons (p.s124vfsx10 and p.r217pfsx8, respectively) in two different families. sanger sequencing confirmed these two mutations and revealed a missense prrt2 mutation (c.859g -&gt; a, p.a287t) in one of the two remaining families. this study also sequenced prrt2 in 29 sporadic cases affected with pkc and identified mutations in 10 cases, including six with the c.649dupc mutation. most variants were truncating mutations, consistent with loss-of-function and haploinsufficiency. 
 conclusion the present study identifies prrt2 as the gene mutated in a subset of pkc, and suggests that pkc is genetically heterogeneous.

946,"blue shark prionace glauca fin-to-carcass-mass ratios in spain and implications for finning ban enforcement. this study examines the processing of fins from blue sharks prionace glauca caught by the spanish longline fleet and landed in vigo, spain, and implications of these practices for enforcing the e.u. ban on shark finning, which relies on a maximum fin-to-carcass-mass ratio. two major sources of variability in fin-to-carcass ratios are quantified and discussed: (1) the fin set (type and number of fins retained from each shark) and (2) the cutting method used to separate fins from carcasses. the significant differences in fin-to-carcass-mass ratios between fin sets or cutting procedure demonstrates that the ratio limit is problematic and, conclusively, in order to facilitate proper enforcement, fishermen should be required to land all sharks with the fins still naturally attached to the bodies.

947,"probabilistic modeling of chloride-induced corrosion in concrete structures using first- and second-order reliability methods. concrete structures are subjected to chloride-induced corrosion that can lead to shortened service life. reliable predictions of life cycle performance of concrete structures are critical to the optimization of their life cycle design and maintenance to minimize their life cycle costs. this paper presents two simplified semi-analytical probabilistic models based on the first- and second-order reliability methods to model the uncertainty of the key parameters including surface chloride concentration, chloride threshold, cover depth and diffusion coefficient, which govern the chloride ingress into concrete and corrosion of reinforcing steel. a case study of a reinforced concrete highway bridge deck is used to illustrate the capability and efficiency of these simplified probabilistic models in modeling the uncertainty and predicting the time-dependent probability of corrosion. the models enable to quantify the impact of the different governing parameters on probability of corrosion and service life, which can be used to develop cost-effective management strategies. crown copyright (c) 2012 published by elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.

950,"hiv and dyadic intervention: an interdependence and communal coping analysis. background: the most common form of hiv transmission in sub-saharan africa is heterosexual sex between two partners. while most hiv prevention interventions are aimed at the individual, there is mounting evidence of the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of dyadic interventions. however, the mechanisms through which dyadic-level interventions achieve success remain little explored. we address this gap by using lewis et al's interdependence model of couple communal coping and behaviour change to analyse data from partners participating in an hiv prevention trial in uganda and zambia. 
 methods and findings: we conducted a comparative qualitative study using in-depth interviews. thirty-three interviews were conducted in total; ten with couples and twenty-three with staff members at the two sites. the ugandan site recruited a sero-discordant couple cohort and the zambian site recruited women alone. spouses' transformation of motivation is strong where couples are recruited and both partners stand to gain considerably by participating in the research; it is weaker where this is not the case. as such, coping mechanisms differ in the two sites; among sero-discordant couples in uganda, communal coping is evidenced through joint consent to participate, regular couple counselling and workshops, sharing of hiv test results, and strong spousal support for adherence and retention. by contrast, coping at the zambian site is predominantly left to the individual woman and occurs against a backdrop of mutual mistrust and male disenfranchisement. we discuss these findings in light of practical and ethical considerations of recruiting couples to hiv research. 
 conclusions: we argue for the need to consider the broader context within which behaviour change occurs and propose that future dyadic research be situated within the framework of the 'risk environment'.

952,"reliable iris localization using integral projection function an 2d-shape properties. iris recognition technology recognizes a human based on his/her iris pattern. however, the accuracy of the iris recognition technology depends on accurate iris localization. localizing a pupil region in the presence of other low-intensity regions, such as hairs, eyebrows, and eyelashes, is a challenging task. this study proposes an iris localization technique that includes a localizing pupillary boundary in a sub-image by using an integral projection function and two-dimensional shape properties (e.g., area, geometry, and circularity). the limbic boundary is localized using gradients and an error distance transform, and the boundary is regularized with active contours. experimental results obtained from public databases show the superiority of the proposed technique over contemporary methods.

955,"geochemistry of hot springs in the tengchong hydrothermal areas, southwestern china. as an important volcanic geothermal region in china. tengchong belongs to the mediterranean-himalayas geothermal belt and is characterized by wide distribution of volcanic rocks. fifty-eight hydrothermal areas have been identified in tengchong, among which the rehai hydrothermal system is the most geothermally active. the geothermal waters from rehai are mainly na-hco3-cl and na-hco3 types, whereas those from the other hydrothermal areas are mainly na-hco3, na-ca-hco3, ca-hco3, ca-mg-hco3, mg-na-ca-hco3, and mg-ca-hco3 types. both quartz geothermometer and k-mg geothermometer indicate that the rehai geothermal field has higher subsurface temperatures than the other hydrothermal areas. except for three rehai samples, most geothermal water samples collected from tengchong are far from the full equilibrium line in giggenbach's triangular diagram, suggesting that the complete chemical re-equilibrium has not been achieved as these geothermal waters flow upward from reservoirs towards spring vents and possibly mix with cooler waters. statistical analysis shows that cl, b, li, rb, and cs are the characteristic constituents of the tengchong geothermal waters, and the good linear relations among these elements in the rehai geothermal waters reflect the existence of a deep parent geothermal liquid (pgl) below rehai. an enthalpy-chloride diagram of the rehai geothermal waters suggests that the parent geothermal liquid has cl-concentration of 291 mg/l and enthalpy of 1495 j/g. the pgl ascends to the surface through different channels and may cool by conduction of heat to reservoir host rocks, by boiling, or by mixing with cooler shallow groundwaters.

957,"a new adaptive fast cellular automaton neighborhood detection and rule identification algorithm. an important step in the identification of cellular automata (ca) is to detect the correct neighborhood before parameter estimation. many authors have suggested procedures based on the removal of redundant neighbors from a very large initial neighborhood one by one to find the real model, but this often induces ill conditioning and overfitting. this is true particularly for a large initial neighborhood where there are few significant terms, and this will be demonstrated by an example in this paper. by introducing a new criteria and three new techniques, this paper proposes a new adaptive fast ca orthogonal-least-square (adaptive-fca-ols) algorithm, which cannot only adaptively search for the correct neighborhood without any preset tolerance but can also considerably reduce the computational complexity and memory usage. several numerical examples demonstrate that the adaptive-fca-ols algorithm has better robustness to noise and to the size of the initial neighborhood than other recently developed neighborhood detection methods in the identification of binary ca.

959,"one if by land, two if by sea: signalling to the ranks with csp and xip. in many streptococci, quorum sensing utilizes secreted, linear peptides that engage cognate receptors to coordinate gene expression among members of a local population. streptococcus mutans employs the secreted peptides csp and xip to stimulate production of antimicrobial bacteriocins and to induce development of competence for genetic transformation. recent progress in the field reveals that these pathways not only monitor the presence of signal emitters but also sense environmental factors. both kinds of information are integrated by regulatory networks that then generate multiple outcomes, even among parallel cells growing in identical conditions. in this issue of molecular microbiology, son and co-workers investigate how two medium types shape cellular responses to csp and xip pheromones in individuals across a population. their findings characterize restrictive properties of media differing in peptidic fragment content and reveal unusual signalling properties that contribute to bimodal responses of gene expression.

965,"actin polymerization controls the organization of wash domains at the surface of endosomes. sorting of cargoes in endosomes occurs through their selective enrichment into sorting platforms, where transport intermediates are generated. the wash complex, which directly binds to lipids, activates the arp2/3 complex and hence actin polymerization onto such sorting platforms. here, we analyzed the role of actin polymerization in the physiology of endosomal domains containing wash using quantitative image analysis. actin depolymerization is known to enlarge endosomes. using a novel colocalization method that is insensitive to the heterogeneity of size and shape of endosomes, we further show that preventing the generation of branched actin networks induces endosomal accumulation of the wash complex. moreover, we found that actin depolymerization induces a dramatic decrease in the recovery of endosomal wash after photobleaching. this result suggests a built-in turnover, where the actin network, i.e. the product of the wash complex, contributes to the dynamic exchange of the wash complex by promoting its detachment from endosomes. our experiments also provide evidence for a role of actin polymerization in the lateral compartmentalization of endosomes: several wash domains exist at the surface of enlarged endosomes, however, the wash domains coalesce upon actin depolymerization or arp2/3 depletion. branched actin networks are thus involved in the regulation of the size of wash domains. the potential role of this regulation in membrane scission are discussed.

969,"ionizing radiation enhances esophageal epithelial cell migration and invasion through a paracrine mechanism involving stromal-derived hepatocyte growth factor. esophageal cancer is the sixth leading cause of cancer death worldwide and the seventh leading cause of cancer death in the u.s. male population. ionizing radiation exposure is a risk factor for development of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, a histological subtype of esophageal cancer that is highly aggressive and is associated with poor patient prognosis. this study investigated the effects of ionizing radiation on the microenvironment and intercellular communication as it relates to esophageal carcinogenesis. we demonstrate that normal esophageal epithelial cells exhibited increased migration and invasion when cultured in the presence of irradiated stromal fibroblasts or with conditioned medium derived from irradiated stromal fibroblasts. cytokine antibody arrays and elisas were used to identify hepatocyte growth factor (hgf) as an abundant protein that is secreted by esophageal fibroblasts at twofold increased levels in culture medium after gamma irradiation. reverse transcription qpcr analysis confirmed an approximately 50% increase in mrna levels for hgf at 1 h in irradiated fibroblasts compared to unirradiated controls. recombinant hgf stimulated increased wound healing, migration and invasion of esophageal epithelial cells, while blocking antibodies against hgf significantly decreased migration and invasion of epithelial cells in coculture with irradiated fibroblasts. since hgf is known to direct cell migration, invasion and metastasis in a variety of tissues, including the esophagus, its modulation by ionizing radiation may have important implications for nontargeted pathways that influence radiation carcinogenesis in the esophagus.

973,"transmission spectrum of venus as a transiting exoplanet. on 5-6 june 2012, venus will be transiting the sun for the last time before 2117. this event is an unique opportunity to assess the feasibility of the atmospheric characterisation of earth-size exoplanets near the habitable zone with the transmission spectroscopy technique and provide an invaluable proxy for the atmosphere of such a planet. in this letter, we provide a theoretical transmission spectrum of the atmosphere of venus that could be tested with spectroscopic observations during the 2012 transit. this is done using radiative transfer across venus' atmosphere, with inputs from in-situ missions such as venus express and theoretical models. the transmission spectrum covers a range of 0.1-5 mu m and probes the limb between 70 and 150 km in altitude. it is dominated in uv by carbon dioxide absorption producing a broad transit signal of similar to 20 ppm as seen from earth, and from 0.2 to 2.7 mu m by mie extinction (similar to 5 ppm at 0.8 mu m) caused by droplets of sulfuric acid composing an upper haze layer above the main deck of clouds. these features are not expected for a terrestrial exoplanet and could help discriminating an earth-like habitable world from a cytherean planet.

977,"a simple and precise conductometric method for the determination of losartan in pharmaceutical products. losartan is an antihypertensive agent that lost its patent protection in 2010, and, consequently, it has been available in generic form. the latter motivated the search for a rapid and precise alternative method. here, a simple conductometric titration in aqueous medium is described for the losartan analysis in pharmaceutical formulations. the first step of the titration occurs with the protonation of losartan producing a white precipitate and resulting in a slow increase in conductivity. when the protonation stage is complete, a sharp increase in conductivity occurs which was determined to be due to the presence of excess of acid. the titrimetric method was applied to the determination of losartan in pharmaceutical products and the results are comparable with values obtained using a chromatographic method recommended by the united states pharmacopoeia. the relative standard deviation for successive measurements of a 125 mg l-1 (2.71x10(-4) mol l-1) losartan solution was approximately 2%. recovery study in tablet samples ranged between 99 and 102.4%. the procedure is fast, simple, and represents an attractive alternative for losartan quantification in routine analysis. in addition, it avoids organic solvents, minimizes the risk of exposure to the operator, and the waste treatment is easier compared to classical chromatographic methods.

982,"free volume estimates of thermodynamic and transport properties of heavy oils with co2. carbon dioxide is to be used to displace crude oil in reservoirs by effecting miscibility. even where no miscibility is reached, as in heavy oils, there are still some advantages. when co2 dissolves in oil, it increases the volume of oil and squeezes it out of narrow capillaries. further, the viscosity of oil also decreases at times by an order of magnitude. to quantify the process it is necessary to know the co2 solubility, the swelling produced, and the changes in viscosity and diffusivity with the co2 content. 
 there is no available theory that unifies both thermodynamic and transport data in a single model with the exception of the free volume theory which applies when the free volume is low. in addition, most models require a molecular weight of oil, where only a weighted average is available and it is questionable if this weighting will work for oils from different sources, or to different physical properties. we start with the density-pressure-temperature data without co2 for heavy oil available in the literature to establish the correlations using the free volume theory and thereby predict the remaining viscosity data. we then interpret the data on swelling by co2 which leads us to the volume fraction of co2. the viscosity data leads us to the free volumes of co2 in oil and allows us to calculate the diffusivities of co2. 
 in all, the energy of solubilization from henry's law constants, theory of interfacial tension and the diffusivity at infinite dilution using stokes-einstein theory are the only instances where we had to go outside the free volume theory. it is also suggested that the predictions are independent of oil type as long as the oil is sufficiently heavy and the properties are correctly scaled.

983,"framing inquiry in high school chemistry: helping students see the bigger picture. inquiry has been advocated as an effective pedagogical strategy for promoting deep conceptual understanding and more sophisticated scientific thinking by numerous bodies associated with chemistry (and science) education. to allow inquiry to achieve these goals, the teacher must manage the amount of cognitive load experienced by students while they engage in inquiry activities. this article can help teachers address that challenge by discussing the notion of framing (a form of scaffolding) and by presenting a model designed to help teachers more effectively frame inquiry activities. using the metaphor of a picture frame, the model introduces five components of the framing process that can be employed by teachers as guidelines for developing the background information they will share with students prior to an inquiry activity. those components are context, goals, actions, tools, and interactions. providing students with such a carefully developed background can better orient them to the purpose of the inquiry activity, put boundaries on the problem space they will be exploring, and reduce the cognitive load as they engage in the activity, all of which should improve the inquiry learning experience.

984,"transcript levels, alternative splicing and proteolytic cleavage of tfiiia control 5s rrna accumulation during arabidopsis thaliana development. ribosome biogenesis is critical for eukaryotic cells and requires coordinated synthesis of the protein and rrna moieties of the ribosome, which are therefore highly regulated. 5s ribosomal rna, an essential component of the large ribosomal subunit, is transcribed by rna polymerase iii and specifically requires transcription factor iiia (tfiiia). to obtain insight into the regulation of 5s rrna transcription, we have investigated the expression of 5s rrna and the exon-skipped (es) and exon-including (ei) tfiiia transcripts, two transcript isoforms that result from alternative splicing of the tfiiia gene, and tfiiia protein amounts with respect to requirements for 5s rrna during development. we show that 5s rrna quantities are regulated through distinct but complementary mechanisms operating through transcriptional and post-transcriptional control of tfiiia transcripts as well as at the post-translational level through proteolytic cleavage of the tfiiia protein. during the reproductive phase, high expression of the tfiiia gene together with low proteolytic cleavage contributes to accumulation of functional, full-length tfiiia protein, and results in 5s rrna accumulation in the seed. in contrast, just after germination, the levels of tfiiia-encoding transcripts are low and stable. full-length tfiiia protein is undetectable, and the level of 5s rrna stored in the embryo progressively decreases. after day 4, in correlation with the reorganization of 5s rdna chromatin to a mature state, full-length tfiiia protein with transcriptional activity accumulates and permits de novo transcription of 5s rrna.

990,"organic no-tillage system effects on soybean, corn and irrigated tomato production and economic performance in iowa, usa. novel technologies to reduce tillage in organic systems include a no-tillage roller/crimper for terminating cover crops prior to commercial crop planting. the objective of this experiment was to compare: (1) weed management and yield effects of organic tilled and no-tillage systems for corn (zea mays l.), soybean [glycine max (l.) merr.] and irrigated tomato (lycopersicon esculentum mill.), using a roller/crimper and two cover crop combinations [hairy vetch/rye (vicia villosa roth/secale cereale l.) and winter wheat/austrian winter pea (triticum vulgare l./pisum sativum l. ssp. arvense (l.) poir.)]; and (2) the economic performance of each system. weed management ranged from fair to excellent in the organic no-tillage system for soybean and tomato crops, with the rye/hairy vetch mulch generally providing the most weed suppression. corn suffered from low rainfall, competition from weeds and hairy vetch re-growth and, potentially, low soil nitrogen (n) from lack of supplemental fertilization and n immobilization during cover crop decomposition. no-tillage corn yields averaged 5618 and 634 kg ha(-1) in 2006 and 2007, respectively, which was 42-92% lower than tilled corn. no-tillage soybeans in 2007 averaged 2793 kg ha(-1) compared to 3170 kg ha(-1) for tilled soybeans, although no-tillage yields were 48% of tilled yields in the dry year of 2006. irrigated tomato yields averaged 40 t ha(-1) in 2006 and 63 t ha(-1) in 2007, with no statistical differences among tillage treatments. economic analysis for the three crops revealed additional cover crop seed and management costs in the no-tillage system. average organic corn returns to management were us$1028 and us$2466 ha(-1) greater in the tilled system compared to the no-tillage system in 2006 and 2007, respectively, which resulted mainly from the dramatically lower no-tillage yields. no-tillage soybean returns to management were negative in 2006, averaging us$-14 ha(-1), compared to us$742 ha(-1) for tilled soybeans. however, in 2007, no-tillage soybean returns averaged us$1096 ha(-1). the 2007 no-tillage irrigated tomato returns to management averaged us$53,515 compared to us$55,515 in the tilled system. overall, the organic no-tillage soybean and irrigated tomato system demonstrated some promise for reducing tillage in organic systems, but until economic benefits from soil carbon enhancement can be included for no-tillage systems, soil improvements probably cannot offset the economic losses in no-tillage systems. irrigation could improve the performance of the no-tillage system in dry years, especially if grain crops are rotated with a high-value irrigated tomato crop.

991,"strategies for success: crisis management model for remediation of at-risk students. student success is a concern for all nursing schools. accountability for nclex (r) pass rates, along with accountability for student attrition and progression, compel nursing schools to carefully select applicants and then actively manage their progress. one of the strategies of managing student progression is to use standardized, nationally normalized exit examinations to identify students at risk for nclex-rn failure. this article describes the response of one baccalaureate nursing program to an unacceptable number of exit examination failures among senior students preparing to graduate. as a unique approach to this matter, a crisis management process was used to assess the problem, to develop and implement an intervention for at-risk students, and to revise program policies to better support ongoing student success.

992,"di-mu-oxido-bis[(2-ethoxy-6-{[2-(2-hydroxyethylamino)ethylimino]methyl}phenolato-kappa n-3,n ',o-1)oxidovanadium(v)]. in the title centrosymmetric dinuclear dioxidovanadium(v) complex, [v-2(c13h19n2o3)(2)o-4], the v-v ion is coordinated by an n,n',o-tridendate 2-ethoxy-6-{[2-(2-hydroxyethylamino)ethylimino] methyl} phenolate ligand and three oxide o atoms, forming a distorted cis-vn2o4 octahedral geometry. the bridging o atoms show one short and one long bond to their two attached v-v atoms. the dihedral angle between the benzene ring of the ligand and the v2o2 plane is 75.2 (3)degrees. the deviation of the v-v ion from the plane defined by the three donor atoms of the tridentate ligand and one bridging oxide o atom is 0.337 (2) angstrom towards the terminal oxide o atom. two n-h center dot center dot center dot o hydrogen bonds help to establish the conformation of the dimer. in the crystal, the complex molecules are linked by o-h center dot center dot center dot o hydrogen bonds, forming [100] chains.

995,"density-functional theory for polymer-carbon dioxide mixtures: a perturbed-chain saft approach. we propose a density-functional theory (dft) describing inhomogeneous polymer-carbon dioxide mixtures based on a perturbed-chain statistical associating fluid theory equation of state (pc-saft eos). the weight density functions from fundamental measure theory are used to extend the bulk excess helmholtz free energy to the inhomogeneous case. the additional long-range dispersion contributions are included using a mean-field approach. we apply our dft to the interfacial properties of polystyrene-co2 and poly(methyl methacrylate) co2 systems. calculated values for both solubility and interfacial tension are in good agreement with experimental data. in comparison with our earlier dft based on the peng-robinson-saft eos, the current dft produces quantitatively superior agreement with experimental data and is free of the unphysical behavior at high pressures (&gt;35 mpa) in the earlier theory.

998,"cancer in light of experimental evolution. cancer initiation, progression, and the emergence of therapeutic resistance are evolutionary phenomena of clonal somatic cell populations. studies in microbial experimental evolution and the theoretical work inspired by such studies are yielding deep insights into the evolutionary dynamics of clonal populations, yet there has been little explicit consideration of the relevance of this rapidly growing field to cancer biology. here, we examine how the understanding of mutation, selection, and spatial structure in clonal populations that is emerging from experimental evolution may be applicable to cancer. along the way, we discuss some significant ways in which cancer differs from the model systems used in experimental evolution. despite these differences, we argue that enhanced prediction and control of cancer may be possible using ideas developed in the context of experimental evolution, and we point out some prospects for future research at the interface between these traditionally separate areas.
